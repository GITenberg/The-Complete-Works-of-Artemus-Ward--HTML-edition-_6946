<h4>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY MELVILLE D. LANDON.</h4>
</center>
<br />
<br />
<p>Charles Farrar Browne, better known to the world as "Artemus
Ward," was born at Waterford, Oxford County, Maine, on the
twenty-sixth of April, 1834, and died of consumption at
Southampton, England, on Wednesday, the sixth of March, 1867.</p>
<p>His father, Levi Browne, was a land surveyor, and Justice of the
Peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;His mother, Caroline E. Brown, is still living,
and is a descendant from Puritan stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Browne's business manager, Mr. Hingston, once asked him
about his Puritanic origin, when he replied: "I think we came from
Jerusalem, for my father's name was Levi and we had a Moses and a
Nathan in the family, but my poor brother's name was Cyrus; so,
perhaps, that makes us Persians."</p>
<p>Charles was partially educated at the Waterford school, when
family circumstances induced his parents to apprentice him to learn
the rudiments of printing in the office of the "Skowhegan Clarion,"
published some miles to the north of his native village.&nbsp; Here
he passed through the dreadful ordeal to which a printer's "devil"
is generally subjected.&nbsp; He always kept his temper; and his
eccentric boy jokes are even now told by the residents of
Skowhegan.</p>
<p>In the spring, after his fifteenth birthday, Charles Browne bade
farewell to the "Skowhegan Clarion;" and we next hear of him in the
office of the "Carpet-Bag," edited by B.P. Shillaber ("Mrs.
Partington").&nbsp; Lean, lank, but strangely appreciative, young
Browne used to "set up" articles from the pens of Charles G.
Halpine ("Miles O'Reilly") and John G. Saxe, the poet.&nbsp; Here
he wrote his first contribution in a disguised hand, slyly put it
into the editorial box, and the next day disguised his pleasure
while setting it up himself.&nbsp; The article was a description of
a Fourth of July celebration in Skowhegan.&nbsp; The spectacle of
the day was a representation of the battle of Yorktown, with G.
Washington and General Horace Cornwallis in character.&nbsp; The
article pleased Mr. Shillaber, and Mr. Browne, afterwards speaking
of it, said: "I went to the theatre that evening, had a good time
of it, and thought I was the greatest man in Boston."</p>
<p>While engaged on the "Carpet-Bag," the subject of our sketch
closely studied the theatre and courted the society of actors and
actresses. &nbsp;It was in this way that he gained that correct and
valuable knowledge of the texts and characters of the drama, which
enabled him in after years to burlesque them so successfully.&nbsp;
The humorous writings of Seba Smith were his models, and the
oddities of "John Phoenix" were his especial admiration.</p>
<p>Being of a roving temper Charles Browne soon left Boston, and,
after traveling as a journeyman printer over much of New York and
Massachusetts, he turned up in the town of Tiffin, Seneca County,
Ohio, where he became reporter and compositor at four dollars per
week.&nbsp; After making many friends among the good citizens of
Tiffin, by whom he is remembered as a patron of side shows and
traveling circuses, our hero suddenly set out for Toledo, on the
lake, where he immediately made a reputation as a writer of
sarcastic paragraphs in the columns of the Toledo
"Commercial."&nbsp; He waged a vigorous newspaper war with the
reporters of the Toledo "Blade," but while the "Blade" indulged in
violent vituperation, "Artemus" was good-natured and full of
humor.&nbsp; His column soon gained a local fame and everybody read
it. His fame even traveled away to Cleveland, where, in 1858, when
Mr. Browne was twenty-four years of age, Mr. J.W. Gray of the
Cleveland "Plaindealer" secured him as local reporter, at a salary
of twelve-dollars per week.&nbsp; Here his reputation first began
to assume a national character and it was here that they called him
a "fool" when he mentioned the idea of taking the field as a
lecturer.&nbsp; Speaking of this circumstance while traveling down
the Mississippi with the writer, in 1865, Mr. Browne musingly
repeated this colloquy:</p>
<p>WISE MAN:&mdash;"Ah! you poor foolish little girl&mdash;here is
a dollar for you."</p>
<p>FOOLISH LITTLE GIRL:&mdash;"Thank you, sir; but I have a sister
at home as foolish as I am; can't you give me a dollar for
her?"</p>
<p>Charles Browne was not successful as a NEWS reporter, lacking
enterprise and energy, but his success lay in writing up in a
burlesque manner well-known public affairs like prize-fights,
races, spiritual meetings, and political gatherings. &nbsp;His
department became wonderfully humorous, and was always a favorite
with readers, whether there was any news in it or not.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would have a whole column of letters from young ladies
in reply to a fancied matrimonial advertisement, and then he would
have a column of answers to general correspondents like
this:&mdash;</p>
<p>VERITAS:&mdash;Many make the same error. Mr. Key, who wrote the
"Star Spangled Banner," is not the author of Hamlet, a
tragedy.&nbsp; &nbsp;He wrote the banner business, and assisted in
"The Female Pirate," BUT DID NOT WRITE HAMLET.&nbsp; Hamlet was
written by a talented but unscrupulous man named Macbeth,
afterwards tried and executed for "murdering sleep."</p>
<p>YOUNG CLERGYMAN:&mdash;Two pints of rum, two quarts of hot
water, tea-cup of sugar, and a lemon; grate in nutmeg, stir
thoroughly and drink while hot.</p>
<p>It was during his engagement on the "Plaindealer" that he wrote,
dating from Indiana, his first communication,&mdash;the first
published letter following this sketch, signed "Artemus Ward" a
sobriquet purely incidental, but borne with the "u" changed to an
"a" by an American revolutionary general.&nbsp; It was here that
Mr. Browne first became, IN WORDS, the possessor of a moral show
"consisting of three moral bares, the a kangaroo (a amoozing little
rascal; 'twould make you larf yourself to death to see the little
kuss jump and squeal), wax figures of G. Washington, &amp;c.
&amp;c."&nbsp; Hundreds of newspapers copied this letter, and
Charles Browne awoke one morning to find himself famous.</p>
<p>In the "Plaindealer" office, his companion, George Hoyt, writes:
"His desk was a rickety table which had been whittled and gashed
until it looked as if it had been the victim of lightning.
&nbsp;His chair was a fit companion thereto,&mdash;a wabbling,
unsteady affair, sometimes with four and sometimes with three
legs.&nbsp; But Browne saw neither the table, nor the chair, nor
any person who might be near, nothing, in fact, but the funny
pictures which were tumbling out of his brain.&nbsp; When writing,
his gaunt form looked ridiculous enough.&nbsp; One leg hung over
the arm of his chair like a great hook, while he would write away,
sometimes laughing to himself, and then slapping the table in the
excess of his mirth."</p>
<p>While in the office of the "Plaindealer," Mr. Browne first
conceived the idea of becoming a lecturer. In attending the various
minstrel shows and circuses which came to the city, he would
frequently hear repeated some story of his own which the audience
would receive with hilarity.&nbsp; His best witticisms came back to
him from the lips of another who made a living by quoting a stolen
jest.&nbsp; Then the thought came to him to enter the lecture field
himself, and become the utterer of his own witticisms&mdash;the
mouthpiece of his own jests.</p>
<p>On the 10th of November, 1860, Charles Browne, whose fame,
traveling in his letters from Boston to San Francisco, had now
become national, grasped the hands of his hundreds of New York
admirers.&nbsp; Cleveland had throned him the monarch of mirth, and
a thousand hearts paid him tributes of adulation as he closed his
connection with the Cleveland Press.</p>
<p>Arriving in the Empire City, Mr. Browne soon opened an
engagement with "Vanity Fair," a humorous paper after the manner of
London "Punch," and ere long he succeeded Mr. Charles G. Leland as
editor.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Dawson Shanly says: "After Artemus Ward
became sole editor, a position which he held for a brief period,
many of his best contributions were given to the public; and,
whatever there was of merit in the columns of "Vanity Fair" from
the time he assumed the editorial charge, emanated from his pen."
&nbsp;Mr. Browne himself wrote to a friend: "Comic copy is what
they wanted for "Vanity Fair."&nbsp; I wrote some and it killed it.
The poor paper got to be a conundrum, and so I gave it up."</p>
<p>The idea of entering the field as a lecturer now seized Mr.
Browne stronger than ever.&nbsp; Tired of the pen, he resolved on
trying the platform.&nbsp; His Bohemian friends agreed that his
fame and fortune would be made before intelligent audiences.
&nbsp;He resolved to try it.&nbsp; What should be the subject of my
lecture? &nbsp;How shall I treat the subject? &nbsp;These questions
caused Mr. Browne grave speculations.&nbsp; Among other schemes, he
thought of a string of jests combined with a stream of satire, the
whole being unconnected&mdash;a burlesque upon a lecture.&nbsp; The
subject,&mdash;that was a hard question. &nbsp;First he thought of
calling it "My Seven Grandmothers," but he finally adopted the name
of "Babes in the Woods," and with this subject Charles Browne was
introduced to a metropolitan audience, on the evening of December
23d, 1861.&nbsp; The place was Clinton Hall, which stood on the
site of the old Astor Place Opera House, where years ago occurred
the Macready riot, and where now is the Mercantile Library.
&nbsp;Previous to this introduction, Mr. Frank Wood accompanied him
to the suburban town of Norwich, Connecticut, where he first
delivered his lecture, and watched the result.&nbsp; The audience
was delighted, and Mr. Browne received an ovation. Previous to his
Clinton Hall appearance the city was flooded with funny placards
reading&mdash;</p>
<center><img alt="Atemus Ward will speak a piece." hspace="0" src=
"images/01.gif" /></center>
<br />
<p>Owing to a great storm, only a small audience braved the
elements, and the Clinton Hall lecture was not a financial success.
&nbsp;It consisted of a wandering batch of comicalities, touching
upon everything except "The Babes." &nbsp;Indeed it was better
described by the lecturer in London, when he said, "One of the
features of my entertainment is, that it contains so many things
that don't have anything to do with it."</p>
<p>In the middle of his lecture, the speaker would hesitate, stop,
and say: "Owing to a slight indisposition we will now have an
intermission of fifteen minutes." &nbsp;The audience looked in
utter dismay at the idea of staring at vacancy for a quarter of an
hour, when, rubbing his hands, the lecturer would continue: "but,
ah&mdash;during the intermission I will go on with my lecture!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Mr. Browne's first volume, entitled "Artemus Ward; His Book,"
was published in New York, May 17th, 1862.&nbsp; The volume was
everywhere hailed with enthusiasm, and over forty thousand copies
were sold.&nbsp; Great success also attended the sale of his three
other volumes published in '65, '67, and '69.</p>
<p>Mr. Browne's next lecture was entitled "Sixty Minutes in
Africa," and was delivered in Musical Fund Hall,
Philadelphia.&nbsp; Behind him hung a large map of Africa, "which
region," said Artemus, "abounds in various natural productions,
such as reptiles and flowers. &nbsp;It produces the red rose, the
white rose, and the neg-roes. &nbsp;In the middle of the continent
is what is called a 'howling wilderness,' but, for my part, I have
never heard it howl, nor met with any one who has."</p>
<p>After Mr. Browne had created immense enthusiasm for his lectures
and books in the Eastern States, which filled his pockets with a
handsome exchequer, he started, October 3d, 1863, for California, a
faithful account of which trip is given by himself in this
book.&nbsp; Previous to starting, he received a telegram from
Thomas Maguire, of the San Francisco Opera House, inquiring "what
he would <i>take for forty nights in Californis</i>."&nbsp; Mr.
Brown immediately telegraphed back,&mdash;</p>
<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>"Brandy and water.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>A. Ward."</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>And, though Maguire was sorely puzzled at the contents of the
dispatch, the Press got hold of it, and it went through California
as a capital joke.</p>
<p>Mr. Browne first lectured in San Francisco on "The Babes in the
Woods," November 13th, 1863, at Pratt's Hall.&nbsp; T. Starr King
took a deep interest in him, occupying the rostrum, and his general
reception in San Francisco was warm.</p>
<p>Returning overland, through Salt Lake to the States, in the fall
of 1864, Mr. Browne lectured again in New York, this time on the
"Mormons," to immense audiences, and in the spring of 1865 he
commenced his tour through the country, everywhere drawing
enthusiastic audiences both North and South.</p>
<p>It was while on this tour that the writer of this sketch again
spent some time with him.&nbsp; We met at Memphis and traveled down
the Mississippi together.&nbsp; At Lake Providence the "Indiana"
rounded up to our landing, and Mr. Browne accompanied the writer to
his plantation, where he spent several days, mingling in seeming
infinite delight with the negroes.&nbsp; For them he showed great
fondness, and they used to stand around him in crowds listening to
his seemingly serious advice. &nbsp;We could not prevail upon him
to hunt or to join in any of the equestrian amusements with the
neighboring planters, but a quiet fascination drew him to the
negroes.&nbsp; Strolling through the "quarters," his grave words,
too deep with humor for darkey comprehension, gained their entire
confidence.&nbsp; One day he called up Uncle Jeff., an
Uncle-Tom-like patriarch, and commenced in his usual vein: "Now,
Uncle Jefferson," he said, "why do you thus pursue the habits of
industry?&nbsp; This course of life is wrong&mdash;all
wrong&mdash;all a base habit, Uncle Jefferson. &nbsp;Now try to
break it off.&nbsp; Look at me,&mdash;look at Mr. Landon, the
chivalric young Southern plantist <i>from New York</i>, he toils
not, neither does he spin; he pursues a career of contented
idleness.&nbsp; If you only thought so, Jefferson, you could live
for months <i>without performing any kund of labor</i>, and at the
expiration of that time <i>feel fresh and vigorous enough to
commence it again</i>. &nbsp;Idleness refreshes the physical
organization&mdash;<i>it is a sweet boon!</i>&nbsp; Strike at the
roots of the destroying habit to-day, Jefferson. &nbsp;It tires you
out; resolve to be idle; no one should labor; <i>he should hire
others to do it for him;</i>" and then he would fix his mournful
eyes on Jeff. and hand him a dollar, while the eyes of the
wonder-struck darkey would gaze in mute admiration upon the good
and wise originator of the only theory which the darkey mind could
appreciate. &nbsp;As Jeff. went away to tell the wonderful story to
his companions, and backed it with the dollar as material proof,
Artemus would cover his eyes, and bend forward on his elbows in a
chuckling laugh.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Among the Mormons" was delivered through the States, everywhere
drawing immense crowds.&nbsp; His manner of delivering his
discourse was grotesque and comical beyond description.&nbsp; His
quaint and sad style contributed more than anything else to render
his entertainment exquisitely funny.&nbsp; The programme was
exceedingly droll, and the tickets of admission presented the most
ludicrous of ideas.&nbsp; The writer presents a fac-simile of an
admission ticket which was presented to him in Natchez by Mr.
Browne:&mdash;</p>
<center><img alt=
"Admit the Bearer and one wife. Yours trooly, A. Ward" src=
"images/02.gif" /></center>
<p>In the spring of 1866, Charles Browne first timidly thought of
going to Europe.&nbsp; Turning to Mr. Hingston one day he asked:
"What sort of a man is Albert Smith? &nbsp;Do you think the Mormons
would be as good a subject to the Londoners as Mont Blanc
was?"&nbsp; Then he said: "I should like to go to London and give
my lecture in the same place.&nbsp; Can't it be done?"</p>
<p>Mr. Browne sailed for England soon after, taking with him his
Panorama.&nbsp; The success that awaited him could scarcely have
been anticipated by his most intimate friends.&nbsp; Scholars,
wits, poets, and novelists came to him with extended hands, and his
stay in London was one ovation to the genius of American wit.&nbsp;
Charles Reade, the novelist, was his warm friend and enthusiastic
admirer; and Mr. Andrew Haliday introduced him to the "Literary
Club," where he became a great favorite.&nbsp; Mark Lemon came to
him and asked him to become a contributor to "Punch," which he
did.&nbsp; His "Punch" letters were more remarked in literary
circles than any other current matter.&nbsp; There was hardly a
club-meeting or a dinner at which they were not discussed.&nbsp;
"There was something so grotesque in the idea," said a
correspondent, "of this ruthless Yankee poking among the revered
antiquities of Britain, that the beef-eating British themselves
could not restrain their laughter." &nbsp;The story of his Uncle
William who "followed commercial pursuits, glorious
commerce&mdash;and sold soap," and his letters on the Tower and
"Chowser," were palpable hits, and it was admitted that "Punch" had
contained nothing better since the days of "Yellowplush."&nbsp;
This opinion was shared by the "Times," the literary reviews, and
the gayest leaders of society.&nbsp; The publishers of "Punch"
posted up his name in large letters over their shop in Fleet
Street, and Artemus delighted to point it out to his friends.
&nbsp;About this time Mr. Browne wrote to his friend Jack Rider, of
Cleveland:</p>
<p>"This is the proudest moment of my life.&nbsp; To have been as
well appreciated here as at home; to have written for the oldest
comic Journal in the English language, received mention with Hood,
with Jerrold and Hook, and to have my picture and my pseudonym as
common in London as in New York, is enough for</p>

<p>England was thoroughly aroused to the merits of Artemus Ward,
before he commenced his lectures at Egyptian Hall, and when, in
November, he finally appeared, immense crowds were compelled to
turn away.&nbsp; At every lecture his fame increased, and when
sickness brought his brilliant success to an end, a nation mourned
his retirement.</p>
<p>On the evening of Friday, the seventh week of his engagement at
Egyptian Hall, Artemus became seriously ill, an apology was made to
a disappointed audience, and from that time the light of one of the
greatest wits of the centuries commenced fading into
darkness.&nbsp; The Press mourned his retirement, and a funeral
pall fell over London.&nbsp; The laughing, applauding crowds were
soon to see his consumptive form moving towards its narrow
resting-place in the cemetery at Kensal Green.</p>
<p>By medical advice Charles Browne went for a short time to the
Island of Jersey&mdash;but the breezes of Jersey were powerless.
&nbsp;He wrote to London to his nearest and dearest
friends&mdash;the members of a literary club of which he was a
member&mdash;to complain that his "loneliness weighed on him."
&nbsp;He was brought back, but could not sustain the journey
farther than Southampton.&nbsp; There the members of the club
traveled from London to see him&mdash;two at a time&mdash;that he
might be less lonely.</p>
<p>His remains were followed to the grave from the rooms of his
friend Arthur Sketchley, by a large number of friends and admirers,
the literati and press of London paying the last tribute of respect
to their dead brother.&nbsp; The funeral services were conducted by
the Rev. M.D. Conway, formerly of Cincinnati, and the coffin was
temporarily placed in a vault, from which it was removed by his
American friends, and his body now sleeps by the side of his
father, Levi Browne, in the quiet cemetery at Waterford,
Maine.&nbsp; Upon the coffin is the simple inscription:&mdash;</p>
<center><img alt=
"Charles F. Browne, aged 32 years, better known to the world as 'Artemus Ward'"
src="images/03.gif" /></center>
<p>His English executors were T.W. Robertson, the playwright, and
his friend and companion, E.P. Hingston.&nbsp; His literary
executors were Horace Greeley and Richard H. Stoddard. &nbsp;In his
will, he bequeathed among other things a large sum of money to his
little valet, a bright little fellow; though subsequent denouments
revealed the fact that he left only a six-thousand-dollar house in
Yonkers.&nbsp; There is still some mystery about his finances,
which may one day be revealed.&nbsp; It is known that he withdrew
10,000 dollars from the Pacific Bank to deposit it with a friend
before going to England; besides this, his London "Punch" letters
paid a handsome profit.&nbsp; Among his personal friends were
George Hoyt, the late Daniel Setchell, Charles W. Coe, and Mr.
Mullen, the artist, all of whom he used to style "my friends all
the year round."</p>
<p>Personally Charles Farrar Browne was one of the kindest and most
affectionate of men, and history does not name a man who was so
universally beloved by all who knew him.&nbsp; It was remarked, and
truly, that the death of no literary character since Washington
Irving caused such general and widespread regret.</p>
<p>In stature he was tall and slender. &nbsp;His nose was
prominent,&mdash;outlined like that of Sir Charles Napier, or Mr.
Seward; his eyes brilliant, small, and close together; his mouth
large, teeth white and pearly; fingers long and slender; hair soft,
straight, and blonde; complexion florid; mustache large, and his
voice soft and clear.&nbsp; In bearing, he moved like a
natural-born gentleman. &nbsp;In his lectures he never
smiled&mdash;not even while he was giving utterance to the most
delicious absurdities; but all the while the jokes fell from his
lips as if he was unconscious of their meaning.&nbsp; While writing
his lectures, he would laugh and chuckle to himself
continually.</p>
<p>There was one peculiarity about Charles Browne&mdash;<i>He never
made an enemy.</i>&nbsp; Other wits in other times have been
famous, but a satirical thrust now and then has killed a friend.
&nbsp;Diogenes was the wit of Greece, but when, after holding up an
old dried fish to draw away the eyes of Anaximenes' audience, he
exclaimed "<i>See how an old fish is more interesting than
Anaximenes</i>," he said a funny thing, but he stabbed a
friend.&nbsp; When Charles Lamb, in answer to the doting mother's
question as to how he liked babies, replied, "b-b-boiled, madam,
<i>boiled</i>!" that mother loved him no more: and when John
Randolph said <i>"thank you!"</i> to his constituent who kindly
remarked that he had the pleasure of <i>passing</i> his house, it
was wit at the expense of friendship.&nbsp; The whole English
school of wits&mdash;with Douglas Jerrold, Hood, Sheridan, and
Sidney Smith, indulged in repartee.&nbsp; They were
<i>parasitic</i> wits.&nbsp; And so with the Irish, except that an
Irishman is generally so ridiculously absurd in his replies as to
only excite ridicule.&nbsp; "Artemus Ward" made you laugh and love
him too.</p>
<p>The wit of "Artemus Ward" and "Josh Billings" is distinctively
American. &nbsp;Lord Kames, in his "Elements of Criticism," makes
no mention of this species of wit, a lack which the future
rhetorician should look to.&nbsp; We look in vain for it in the
English language of past ages, and in other languages of modern
time. &nbsp;It is the <i>genus</i> American.&nbsp; When Artemus
says in that serious manner, looking admiringly at his atrocious
pictures,&mdash;"I love pictures&mdash;and I have many of
them&mdash;beautiful photographs&mdash;<font size="2">of
myself</font>;" you smile; and when he continues, "These pictures
were painted by the Old Masters; they painted these pictures and
then they&mdash;they expired;" you hardly know what it is that
makes you laugh outright; and when Josh Billings says in his
Proverbs, wiser than Solomon's "You'd better not know so much, than
know so many things that ain't so;"&mdash;the same vein is struck,
but the text-books fail to explain scientifically the cause of our
mirth.</p>
<p>The wit of Charles Browne is of the most exalted kind.&nbsp; It
is only scholars and those thoroughly acquainted with the
<i>subtilty</i> of our language who fully appreciate it.&nbsp; His
wit is generally about historical personages like Cromwell,
Garrick, or Shakspeare, or a burlesque on different styles of
writing, like his French novel, when <i>hifalutin</i> phrases of
tragedy come from the clodhopper who&mdash;"sells soap and
thrice&mdash;refuses a ducal coronet."</p>
<p>Mr. Browne mingled the eccentric even in his business letters.
&nbsp;Once he wrote to his Publisher, Mr. G.W. Carleton, who had
made some alterations in his MSS.: "The next book I write I'm going
to get <i>you</i> to write." &nbsp;Again he wrote in 1863:</p>
<p>"Dear Carl:&mdash;You and I will get out a book next spring,
which will knock spots out of all comic books in ancient or modern
history. And the fact that you are going to take hold of it
convinces me that you have one of the most <i>massive</i>
intellects of this or any other epoch.</p>

<p>When Charles F. Browne died, he did not belong to America, for,
as with Irving and Dickens, the English language claimed him.&nbsp;
Greece alone did not suffer when the current of Diogenes' wit
flowed on to death.&nbsp; Spain alone did not mourn when Cervantes,
dying, left Don Quixote, the "knight of la Mancha." &nbsp;When
Charles Lamb ceased to tune the great heart of humanity to joy and
gladness, his funeral was in every English and American household;
and when Charles Browne took up his silent resting-place in the
sombre shades of Kensal Green, <i>jesting ceased</i>, and one great
Anglo-American heart,</p>

</center>
<br />
<p>The Shakers is the strangest religious sex I ever met.&nbsp; I'd
hearn tell of 'em and I'd seen 'em, with their broad brim'd hats
and long wastid coats; but I'd never cum into immejit contack with
'em, and I'd sot 'em down as lackin intelleck, as I'd never seen
'em to my Show&mdash;leastways, if they cum they was disgised in
white peple's close, so I didn't know 'em.</p>
<p>But in the Spring of 18&mdash;, I got swampt in the exterior of
New York State, one dark and stormy night, when the winds Blue
pityusly, and I was forced to tie up with the Shakers.</p>
<p>I was toilin threw the mud, when in the dim vister of the futer
I obsarved the gleams of a taller candle.&nbsp; Tiein a hornet's
nest to my off hoss's tail to kinder encourage him, I soon reached
the place.&nbsp; I knockt at the door, which it was opened unto me
by a tall, slick-faced, solum lookin individooal, who turn'd out to
be a Elder.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaker," sed I, "you see before you a Babe in the woods, so
to speak, and he axes shelter of you."</p>
<p>"Yay," sed the Shaker, and he led the way into the house,
another Shaker bein sent to put my hosses and waggin under
kiver.</p>
<p>A solum female, lookin sumwhat like a last year's beanpole stuck
into a long meal bag, cum in axed me was I athurst and did I
hunger? to which I urbanely anserd "a few."&nbsp;She went orf and I
endeverd to open a conversashun with the old man.</p>
<p>"Elder, I spect?" sed I.</p>
<p>"Yay," he said.</p>
<p>"Helth's good, I reckon?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"What's the wages of a Elder, when he understans his
bizness&mdash;or do you devote your sarvices gratooitus?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"Stormy night, sir."</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"If the storm continners there'll be a mess underfoot, hay?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"It's onpleasant when there's a mess underfoot?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"If I may be so bold, kind sir, what's the price of that
pecooler kind of weskit you wear, incloodin trimmins?"</p>
<p>"Yay!"</p>
<p>I pawsd a minit, and then, thinkin I'd be faseshus with him and
see how that would go, I slapt him on the shoulder, bust into a
harty larf, and told him that as a yayer he had no livin ekal.</p>
<p>He jumpt up as if Bilin water had bin squirted into his ears,
groaned, rolled his eyes up tords the sealin and sed: "You're a man
of sin!"&nbsp; He then walkt out of the room.</p>
<p>Jest then the female in the meal bag stuck her hed into the room
and statid that refreshments awaited the weary travler, and I sed
if it was vittles she ment the weary travler was agreeable, and I
follored her into the next room.</p>
<p>I sot down to the table and the female in the meal bag pored out
sum tea.&nbsp; She sed nothin, and for five minutes the only live
thing in that room was a old wooden clock, which tickt in a subdood
and bashful manner in the corner.&nbsp; This dethly stillness made
me oneasy, and I determined to talk to the female or bust.&nbsp; So
sez I, "marrige is agin your rules, I bleeve, marm?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"The sexes liv strickly apart, I spect?"</p>
<p>"Yay."</p>
<p>"It's kinder singler," sez I, puttin on my most sweetest look
and speakin in a winnin voice, "that so fair a made as thow never
got hitched to some likely feller." [N.B.&mdash;She was upards of
40 and homely as a stump fence, but I thawt I'd tickil her.]</p>
<p>"I don't like men!" she sed, very short.</p>
<p>"Wall, I dunno," sez I, "they're a rayther important part of the
populashun.&nbsp; I don't scacely see how we could git along
without 'em."</p>
<p>"Us poor wimin folks would git along a grate deal better if
there was no men!"</p>
<p>"You'll excoos me, marm, but I don't think that air would
work.&nbsp; It wouldn't be regler."</p>
<p>"I'm fraid of men!" she sed.</p>
<p>"That's onnecessary, marm.&nbsp; YOU ain't in no danger.&nbsp;
Don't fret yourself on that pint."</p>
<p>"Here we're shot out from the sinful world.&nbsp; Here all is
peas.&nbsp; Here we air brothers and sisters. &nbsp; We don't marry
and consekently we hav no domestic difficulties.&nbsp; Husbans
don't abooze their wives&mdash;wives don't worrit their
husbans.&nbsp; There's no children here to worrit us.&nbsp; Nothin
to worrit us here.&nbsp; No wicked matrimony here.&nbsp; Would thow
like to be a Shaker?"</p>
<p>"No," sez I, "it ain't my stile."</p>
<p>I had now histed in as big a load of pervishuns as I could carry
comfortable, and, leanin back in my cheer, commenst pickin my teeth
with a fork.&nbsp; The female went out, leavin me all alone with
the clock.&nbsp; I hadn't sot thar long before the Elder poked his
hed in at the door.&nbsp; "You're a man of sin!" he sed, and
groaned and went away.</p>
<p>Direckly thar cum in two young Shakeresses, as putty and slick
lookin gals as I ever met.&nbsp; It is troo they was drest in meal
bags like the old one I'd met previsly, and their shiny, silky har
was hid from sight by long white caps, sich as I spose female Josts
wear; but their eyes sparkled like diminds, their cheeks was like
roses, and they was charmin enuff to make a man throw stuns at his
granmother if they axed him to.&nbsp; They comenst clearin away the
dishes, castin shy glances at me all the time.&nbsp; I got
excited.&nbsp; I forgot Betsy Jane in my rapter, and sez I, "my
pretty dears, how air you?"</p>
<p>"We air well," they solumly sed.</p>
<p>"Whar's the old man?" sed I, in a soft voice.</p>
<p>"Of whom dost thow speak&mdash;Brother Uriah?"</p>
<p>"I mean the gay and festiv cuss who calls me a man of sin.&nbsp;
Shouldn't wonder if his name was Uriah."</p>
<p>"He has retired."</p>
<p>"Wall, my pretty dears," sez I, "let's have sum fun.&nbsp; Let's
play puss in the corner.&nbsp; What say?"</p>
<p>"Air you a Shaker, sir?" they axed.</p>
<p>"Wall my pretty dears, I haven't arrayed my proud form in a long
weskit yit, but if they was all like you perhaps I'd jine
'em.&nbsp; As it is, I'm a Shaker pro-temporary."</p>
<p>They was full of fun.&nbsp; I seed that at fust, only they was a
leetle skeery.&nbsp; I tawt 'em Puss in the corner and sich like
plase, and we had a nice time, keepin quiet of course so the old
man shouldn't hear.&nbsp; When we broke up, sez I, "my pretty
dears, ear I go you hav no objections, hav you, to a innersent kiss
at partin?"</p>
<p>"Yay," they said, and I YAY'D.</p>
<p>I went up stairs to bed.&nbsp; I spose I'd bin snoozin half an
hour when I was woke up by a noise at the door.&nbsp; I sot up in
bed, leanin on my elbers and rubbin my eyes, and I saw the follerin
picter:&nbsp; The Elder stood in the doorway, with a taller candle
in his hand.&nbsp; He hadn't no wearin appeerel on except his night
close, which flutterd in the breeze like a Seseshun flag.&nbsp; He
sed, "You're a man of sin!" then groaned and went away.</p>
<p>I went to sleep agin, and drempt of runnin orf with the pretty
little Shakeresses mounted on my Californy Bar.&nbsp; I thawt the
Bar insisted on steerin strate for my dooryard in Baldinsville and
that Betsy Jane cum out and giv us a warm recepshun with a panfull
of Bilin water.&nbsp; I was woke up arly by the Elder.&nbsp; He
said efreshments was reddy for me down stairs.&nbsp; Then sayin I
was a man of sin, he went groanin away.</p>
<p>As I was goin threw the entry to the room where the vittles was,
I cum across the Elder and the old female I'd met the night before,
and what d'ye spose they was up to?&nbsp; Huggin and kissin like
young lovers in their gushingist state.&nbsp; Sez I, "my Shaker
friends, I reckon you'd better suspend the rules and git
married."</p>
<p>"You must excoos Brother Uriah," sed the female; "he's subjeck
to fits and hain't got no command over hisself when he's into
'em."</p>
<p>"Sartinly," sez I, "I've bin took that way myself frequent."</p>
<p>"You're a man of sin!" sed the Elder.</p>
<p>Arter breakfust my little Shaker frends cum in agin to clear
away the dishes.</p>
<p>"My pretty dears," sez I, "shall we YAY agin?"</p>
<p>"Nay," they sed, and I NAY'D.</p>
<p>The Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was to hav
sarvices that mornin, so I put on a clean biled rag and went.&nbsp;
The meetin house was as neat as a pin.&nbsp; The floor was white as
chalk and smooth as glass.&nbsp; The Shakers was all on hand, in
clean weskits and meal bags, ranged on the floor like milingtery
companies, the mails on one side of the room and the females on
tother.&nbsp; They commenst clappin their hands and singin and
dancin.&nbsp; They danced kinder slow at fust, but as they got
warmed up they shaved it down very brisk, I tell you.&nbsp; Elder
Uriah, in particler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness in
his legs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a dubble
shuffle near where I sot, I rewarded him with a approvin smile and
sed: "Hunky boy!&nbsp; Go it, my gay and festiv cuss!"</p>
<p>"You're a man of sin!" he sed, continnerin his shuffle.</p>
<p>The Sperret, as they called it, then moved a short fat Shaker to
say a few remarks.&nbsp; He sed they was Shakers and all was
ekal.&nbsp; They was the purest and Seleckest peple on the
yearth.&nbsp; Other peple was sinful as they could be, but Shakers
was all right.&nbsp; Shakers was all goin kerslap to the Promist
Land, and nobody want goin to stand at the gate to bar 'em out, if
they did they'd git run over.</p>
<p>The Shakers then danced and sung agin, and arter they was threw,
one of 'em axed me what I thawt of it.</p>
<p>Sez I, "What duz it siggerfy?"</p>
<p>"What?" sez he.</p>

<br />
<p>Baldinsville, Injianny, Sep. the onct, 18&amp;58.&mdash;I was
summund home from Cinsinnaty quite suddin by a lettur from the
Supervizers of Baldinsville, sayin as how grate things was on the
Tappis in that air town in refferunse to sellebratin the compleshun
of the Sub-Mershine Tellergraph &amp; axkin me to be
Pressunt.&nbsp; Lockin up my Kangeroo and wax wurks in a sekure
stile I took my departer for Baldinsville&mdash;"my own, my nativ
lan," which I gut intwo at early kandle litin on the follerin night
&amp; just as the sellerbrashun and illumernashun ware
commensin.</p>
<p>Baldinsville was trooly in a blaze of glory.&nbsp; Near can I
forgit the surblime speckticul which met my gase as I alited from
the Staige with my umbreller and verlis.&nbsp; The Tarvern was lit
up with taller kandles all over &amp; a grate bon fire was burnin
in frunt thareof.&nbsp; A Traspirancy was tied onto the sine post
with the follerin wurds&mdash;"Giv us Liberty or Deth."&nbsp; Old
Tompkinsis grosery was illumernated with 5 tin lantuns and the
follerin Transpirancy was in the winder&mdash;"The Sub-Mershine
Tellergraph &amp; the Baldinsville and Stonefield Plank
Road&mdash;the 2 grate eventz of the 19th centerry&mdash;may
intestines strife never mar their grandjure."&nbsp; Simpkinsis shoe
shop was all ablase with kandles and lantuns.&nbsp; A American
Eagle was painted onto a flag in a winder&mdash;also these wurds,
viz.&mdash;"The Constitooshun must be Presarved."&nbsp; The Skool
house was lited up in grate stile and the winders was filld with
mottoes amung which I notised the follerin&mdash;"Trooth smashed to
erth shall rize agin&mdash;YOU CAN'T STOP HER."&nbsp; "The Boy
stood on the Burnin Deck whense awl but him had Fled."&nbsp;
"Prokrastinashun is the theaf of Time."&nbsp; "Be virtoous &amp;
you will be Happy."&nbsp; "Intemperunse has cawsed a heap of
trubble&mdash;shun the Bole," an the follerin sentimunt written by
the skool master, who graduated at Hudson Kollige: "Baldinsville
sends greetin to Her Magisty the Queen, &amp; hopes all hard
feelins which has heretofore previs bin felt between the
Supervizers of Baldinsville and the British Parlimunt, if such
there has been, may now be forever wiped frum our Escutchuns.&nbsp;
Baldinsville this night rejoises over the gerlorious event which
sementz 2 grate nashuns onto one anuther by means of a elecktric
wire under the roarin billers of the Nasty Deep.&nbsp; QUOSQUE
TANTRUM, A BUTTER, CATERLINY, PATENT NOSTRUM!"&nbsp; Squire Smith's
house was lited up regardlis of expense.&nbsp; His little sun
William Henry stood upon the roof firin orf crackers.&nbsp; The old
'Squire hisself was dressed up in soljer clothes and stood on his
door-step, pintin his sword sollumly to a American flag which was
suspendid on top of a pole in frunt of his house.&nbsp; Frequiently
he wood take orf his cocked hat &amp; wave it round in a impressive
stile.&nbsp; His oldest darter Mis Isabeller Smith, who has just
cum home from the Perkinsville Female Instertoot, appeared at the
frunt winder in the West room as the goddis of liberty, &amp; sung
"I see them on their windin way."&nbsp; Booteus I, sed I to myself,
"you air a angil &amp; nothin shorter.&nbsp; N. Boneparte Smith,
the 'Squire's oldest sun, drest hisself up as Venus the God of Wars
and red the Decleration of Inderpendunse from the left chambir
winder.&nbsp; The 'Squire's wife didn't jine in the
festiverties.&nbsp; She sed it was the tarnulest nonsense she ever
seed.&nbsp; Sez she to the 'Squire, "Cum into the house and go to
bed you old fool, you.&nbsp; Tomorrer you'll be goin round half-ded
with the rumertism &amp; won't gin us a minit's peace till you get
well."&nbsp; Sez the 'Squire, "Betsy, you little appresiate the
importance of the event which I this night commererate."&nbsp; Sez
she, "Commemerate a cat's tail&mdash;cum into the house this
instant, you pesky old critter."&nbsp; "Betsy," sez the 'Squire,
wavin his sword, "retire."&nbsp; This made her just as mad as she
could stick.&nbsp; She retired, but cum out agin putty quick with a
panfull of Bilin hot water which she throwed all over the Squire,
&amp; Surs, you wood have split your sides larfin to see the old
man jump up and holler &amp; run into the house.&nbsp; Except this
unpropishus circumstance all went as merry as a carriage bell, as
Lord Byrun sez.&nbsp; Doctor Hutchinsis offiss was likewise lited
up and a Transpirancy, on which was painted the Queen in the act of
drinkin sum of "Hutchinsis invigorater," was stuck into one of the
winders.&nbsp; The aldinsville Bugle of Liberty noospaper offiss
was also illumernated, &amp; the follerin mottoes stuck
out&mdash;"The Press is the Arkermejian leaver which moves the
world."&nbsp; "Vote Early."&nbsp; "Buckle on your Armer."&nbsp;
"Now is the time to Subscribe."&nbsp; "Franklin, Morse &amp;
Field."&nbsp; "Terms 1.50 dollars a year&mdash;liberal reducshuns
to clubs."&nbsp; In short the villige of Baldinsville was in a
perfect fewroar.&nbsp; I never seed so many peple thar befour in my
born days.&nbsp; Ile not attemp to describe the seens of that grate
night.&nbsp; Wurds wood fale me ef I shood try to do it.&nbsp; I
shall stop here a few periods and enjoy my "Oatem cum dig the

&amp; shall then resume the show biznis, which Ive bin into

<p>My naburs is mourn harf crazy on the new-fangled ideas about

excloosively.&nbsp; A atemt was made to git Mrs. A. Ward to embark

hared fellers told her she was a ethereal creeter &amp; wood make a

drove him out of the house.&nbsp; I will hear obsarve that Mrs.

<p>My naburs injooced me to attend a Sperretooul Sircle at Squire
Smith's.&nbsp; When I arrove I found the east room chock full
includin all the old maids in the villige &amp; the long hared
fellers a4sed.&nbsp; When I went in I was salootid with "hear cums
the benited man"&mdash;&nbsp;"hear cums the hory-heded
unbeleever"&mdash;&nbsp;"hear cums the skoffer at trooth,&nbsp;"
etsettery, etsettery.</p>
<p>Sez I, "my frens, it's troo I'm hear, &amp; now bring on your
Sperrets."</p>
<p>1 of the long hared fellers riz up and sed he would state a few
remarks.&nbsp; He sed man was a critter of intelleck &amp; was
movin on to a Gole.&nbsp; Sum men had bigger intellecks than other
men had and thay wood git to the Gole the soonerest.&nbsp; Sum men
was beests &amp; wood never git into the Gole at all.&nbsp; He sed
the Erth was materiel but man was immaterial, and hens man was
different from the Erth.&nbsp; The Erth, continnered the speaker,
resolves round on its own axeltree onct in 24 hours, but as man
haint gut no axeltree he cant resolve.&nbsp; He sed the ethereal
essunce of the koordinate branchis of super-human natur becum
mettymorfussed as man progrest in harmonial coexistunce &amp;
eventooally anty humanized theirselves &amp; turned into reglar
sperretuellers.&nbsp; (This was versifferusly applauded by the
cumpany, and as I make it a pint to get along as pleasant as
possible, I sung out "bully for you, old boy.")</p>
<p>The cumpany then drew round the table and the Sircle kommenst to
go it.&nbsp; Thay axed me if thare was an body in the Sperret land
which I wood like to convarse with.&nbsp; I sed if Bill Tompkins,
who was onct my partner in the show biznis, was sober, I should
like to convarse with him a few periods.</p>
<p>"Is the Sperret of William Tompkins present?" sed 1 of the long
hared chaps, and there was three knox on the table.</p>
<p>Sez I, "William, how goze it, Old Sweetness?"</p>
<p>"Pretty ruff, old hoss," he replide.</p>
<p>That was a pleasant way we had of addressin each other when he
was in the flesh.</p>
<p>"Air you in the show bizniz, William?" sed I.</p>
<p>He sed he was.&nbsp; He sed he &amp; John Bunyan was travelin
with a side show in connection with Shakspere, Jonson &amp; Co.'s
Circus.&nbsp; He sed old Bun (meanin Mr. Bunyan,) stired up the
animils &amp; ground the organ while he tended door.&nbsp;
Occashunally Mr. Bunyan sung a comic song.&nbsp; The Circus was
doin middlin well.&nbsp; Bill Shakspeer had made a grate hit with
old Bob Ridley, and Ben Jonson was delitin the peple with his
trooly grate ax of hossmanship without saddul or bridal.&nbsp; Thay
was rehersin Dixey's Land &amp; expected it would knock the
peple.</p>
<p>Sez I, "William, my luvly friend, can you pay me that 13 dollars
you owe me?"&nbsp; He sed no with one of the most tremenjis knox I
ever experiunsed.</p>
<p>The Sircle sed he had gone.&nbsp; "Air you gone, William?" I
axed.&nbsp; "Rayther," he replide, and I knowd it as no use to
pursoo the subjeck furder.</p>
<p>I then called fur my farther.</p>
<p>"How's things, daddy?"</p>
<p>"Middlin, my son, middlin."</p>
<p>"Ain't you proud of your orfurn boy?"</p>
<p>"Scacely."</p>
<p>"Why not, my parient?"</p>
<p>"Becawz you hav gone to writin for the noospapers, my son.&nbsp;
Bimeby you'll lose all your character for trooth and
verrasserty.&nbsp; When I helpt you into the show biznis I told you
to dignerfy that there profeshun.&nbsp; Litteratoor is low."</p>
<p>He also statid that he was doin middlin well in the peanut
biznis &amp; liked it putty well, tho' the climit was rather
warm.</p>
<p>When the Sircle stopt thay axed me what I thawt of it.</p>
<p>Sez I, "My frends I've bin into the show biznis now goin on 23
years.&nbsp; Theres a artikil in the Constitooshun of the United
States which sez in effeck that everybody may think just as he darn
pleazes, &amp; them is my sentiments to a hare.&nbsp; You dowtlis
beleeve this Sperret doctrin while I think it is a little
mixt.&nbsp; Just so soon as a man becums a reglar out &amp; out
Sperret rapper he leeves orf workin, lets his hare grow all over
his fase &amp; commensis spungin his livin out of other
peple.&nbsp; He eats all the dickshunaries he can find &amp; goze
round chock full of big words, scarein the wimmin folks &amp;
little children &amp; destroyin the piece of mind of evry famerlee
he enters.&nbsp; He don't do nobody no good &amp; is a cuss to
society &amp; a pirit on honest peple's corn beef barrils.&nbsp;
Admittin all you say abowt the doctrin to be troo, I must say the
reglar perfessional Sperrit rappers&mdash;them as makes a biznis on
it&mdash;air abowt the most ornery set of cusses I ever enkountered
in my life.&nbsp; So sayin I put on my surtoot and went home.</p>

<p>Since I last rit you I've met with immense success a showin my
show in varis places, particly at Detroit.&nbsp; I put up at Mr.
Russel's tavern, a very good tavern too, but I am sorry to inform
you that the clerks tried to cum a Gouge Game on me.&nbsp; I
brandished my new sixteen dollar huntin-cased watch round
considerable, &amp; as I was drest in my store clothes &amp; had a
lot of sweet-scented wagon-grease on my hair, I am free to confess
that I thought I lookt putty gay.&nbsp; It never once struck me
that I lookt green.&nbsp; But up steps a clerk &amp; axes me hadn't
I better put my watch in the Safe.&nbsp; "Sir," sez I, "that watch
cost sixteen dollars!&nbsp; Yes, Sir, every dollar of it!&nbsp; You
can't cum it over me, my boy!&nbsp; Not at all, Sir."&nbsp; I
know'd what the clerk wanted.&nbsp; He wanted that watch
himself.&nbsp; He wanted to make believe as tho he lockt it up in
the safe, then he would set the house a fire and pretend as tho the
watch was destroyed with the other property!&nbsp; But he caught a
Tomarter when he got hold of me.&nbsp; From Detroit I go West'ard
hoe.&nbsp; On the cars was a he-lookin female, with a green-cotton
umbreller in one hand and a handful of Reform tracks in the
other.&nbsp; She sed every woman should have a Spear.&nbsp; Them as
didn't demand their Spears, didn't know what was good for
them.&nbsp; "What is my Spear?" she axed, addressing the people in
the cars.&nbsp; "Is it to stay at home &amp; darn stockins &amp; be
the ser-LAVE of a domineerin man?&nbsp; Or is it my Spear to vote
&amp; speak &amp; show myself the ekal of a man?&nbsp; Is there a
sister in these keers that has her proper Spear?"&nbsp; Sayin which
the eccentric female whirled her umbreller round several times,
&amp; finally jabbed me in the weskit with it.</p>
<p>"I hav no objecshuns to your goin into the Spear bizness," sez
I, "but you'll please remember I ain't a pickeril.&nbsp; Don't
Spear me agin, if you please."&nbsp; She sot down.</p>
<p>At Ann Arbor, bein seized with a sudden faintness, I called for
a drop of suthin to drink.&nbsp; As I was stirrin the beverage up,
a pale-faced man in gold spectacles laid his hand upon my shoulder,
&amp; sed, "Look not upon the wine when it is red!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "This ain't wine.&nbsp; This is Old Rye."</p>
<p>"'It stingeth like a Adder and biteth like a Sarpent!'" sed the
man.</p>
<p>"I guess not," sed I, "when you put sugar into it.&nbsp; That's
the way I allers take mine."</p>
<p>"Have you sons grown up, sir?" the man axed.</p>
<p>"Wall," I replide, as I put myself outside my beverage, "my son
Artemus junior is goin on 18."</p>
<p>"Ain't you afraid if you set this example be4 him he'll cum to a
bad end?"</p>
<p>"He's cum to a waxed end already.&nbsp; He's learnin the shoe
makin bizness," I replide.&nbsp; "I guess we can both on us git
along without your assistance, Sir," I obsarved, as he was about to
open his mouth agin.</p>
<p>"This is a cold world!" sed the man.</p>
<p>"That's so.&nbsp; But you'll get into a warmer one by and by if
you don't mind your own bizness better."&nbsp; I was a little riled
at the feller, because I never take anythin only when I'm
onwell.&nbsp; I arterwards learned he was a temperance lecturer,
and if he can injuce men to stop settin their inards on fire with
the frightful licker which is retailed round the country, I shall
hartily rejoice.&nbsp; Better give men Prusick Assid to onct, than
to pizen 'em to deth by degrees.</p>
<p>At Albion I met with overwhelmin success.&nbsp; The celebrated
Albion Female Semenary is located here, &amp; there air over 300
young ladies in the Institushun, pretty enough to eat without
seasonin or sass.&nbsp; The young ladies was very kind to me,
volunteerin to pin my handbills onto the backs of their
dresses.&nbsp; It was a surblime site to see over 300 young ladies
goin round with a advertisement of A. Ward's onparaleld show,
conspickusly posted onto their dresses.</p>
<p>They've got a Panick up this way and refooze to take Western
money.&nbsp; It never was worth much, and when western men, who
knows what it is, refooze to take their own money it is about time
other folks stopt handlin it.&nbsp; Banks are bustin every day,
goin up higher nor any balloon of which we hav any record.&nbsp;
These western bankers air a sweet &amp; luvly set of men.&nbsp; I
wish I owned as good a house as some of 'em would break into!</p>
<p>Virtoo is its own reward.</p>

here:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I left Baldinsville to go to N.Y.fur to git out
my flamin yeller hanbills fur the Summer kampane, &amp; as I was
peroosin a noospaper on the kars a middel aged man in speckterkuls
kum &amp; sot down beside onto me.&nbsp; He was drest in black
close &amp; was appeerently as fine a man as ever was.</p>
<p>"A fine day, Sir," he did unto me strateway say.</p>
<p>"Middlin," sez I, not wishin to kommit myself, tho he peered to
be as fine a man as there was in the wurld&mdash;"It is a middlin
fine day, Square," I obsarved.</p>
<p>Sez he, "How fares the Ship of State in yure regine of
country?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "We don't hav no ships in our State&mdash;the kanawl is
our best holt."</p>
<p>He pawsed a minit and then sed, "Air yu aware, Sir, that the
krisis is with us?"</p>
<p>"No," sez I, getting up and lookin under the seet, "whare is

<p>"It's hear&mdash;it's everywhares," he sed.</p>
<p>Sez I, "Why how you tawk!" and I gut up agin &amp; lookt all

seet, "that I kan't see nothin of no krisis myself."&nbsp; I felt
sumwhat alarmed, &amp; arose &amp; in a stentoewrian voice obsarved
that if any lady or gentleman in that there kar had a krisis
consealed abowt their persons they'd better projuce it to onct or

out, while a putty little damsell rite behind me in a pinc gown
made the observashun, "He, he."</p>
<p>"Sit down, my fren," sed the man in black close, "yu

<p>"Wall," replide I, "in regard to perlittercal ellerfunts I don't

&amp; unpleasant to hav around.&nbsp; they air powerful hevy eaters
&amp; take up a right smart chans of room, &amp; besides thay air
as ugly and revenjeful, as a Cusscaroarus Injun, with 13 inches of

that he was alludin to, &amp; axed me what was my prinserpuls?</p>
<p>"I haint gut enny," sed I&mdash;"not a prinserpul.&nbsp; Ime in
the show biznis."&nbsp; The man in black close, I will hear
obsarve, seemed to be as fine a man as ever was in the wurld.</p>
<p>"But," sez he, "you hav feelins into you? You cimpathize with
the misfortunit, the loly &amp; the hart-sick, don't you?" He bust
into teers and axed me ef I saw that yung lady in the seet out
yender, pintin to as slick a lookin gal as I ever seed.</p>
<p>Sed I, "2 be shure I see her&mdash;is she mutch sick?"&nbsp; The
man in black close was appeerently as fine a man as ever was in the
wurld ennywhares.</p>
<p>"Draw closter to me," sed the man in black close.&nbsp; "Let me
git my mowth fernenst yure ear.&nbsp; Hush&mdash;SHESE A
OCTOROON!"</p>
<p>"No!" sez I, gittin up in a exsited manner, "yu don't say
so!&nbsp;How long has she bin in that way?"</p>
<p>"Frum her arliest infuncy," sed he.</p>
<p>"Wall, whot upon arth duz she doo it fur?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"She kan't help it," sed the man in black close.&nbsp; "It's the
brand of Kane."</p>
<p>"Wall, she'd better stop drinkin Kane's brandy," I replide.</p>
<p>"I sed the brand of Kane was upon her&mdash;not brandy, my
fren.&nbsp;Yure very obtoose."</p>
<p>I was konsiderbul riled at this.&nbsp; Sez I, "My gentle Sir,
Ime a nonresistanter as a ginral thing, &amp; don't want to git up
no rows with nobuddy, but I kin nevertheles kave in enny man's hed
that calls me a obtoos," with whitch remarks I kommenst fur to pull
orf my extry garmints.&nbsp;"Cum on," sez I&mdash;"Time! hear's the
Beniki Boy fur ye!" &amp; I darnced round like a poppit.&nbsp; He
riz up in his seet &amp; axed my pardin&mdash;sed it was all a
mistake&mdash;that I was a good man, etsettery, &amp; sow 4th,
&amp; we fixt it all up pleasant.&nbsp; I must say the man in black
close seamed to be as fine a man as ever lived in the wurld.&nbsp;
He sed a Octoroon was the 8th of a negrow.&nbsp; He likewise statid
that the female he was travlin with was formurly a slave in
Mississippy; that she'd purchist her freedim &amp; now wantid to
purchiss the freedim of her poor old muther, who (the man in black
close obsarved) was between 87 years of age &amp; had to do all the
cookin &amp; washin for 25 hired men, whitch it was rapidly breakin
down her konstitushun.&nbsp;He sed he knowed the minit he gazed
onto my klassic &amp; beneverlunt fase that I'd donate librully
&amp; axed me to go over &amp; see her, which I accordingly
did.&nbsp; I sot down beside her and sed, "yure Sarvant,
Marm!&nbsp; How do yer git along?"</p>
<p>She bust in 2 teers &amp; sed, "O Sur, I'm so retchid&mdash;I'm
a poor unfortunit Octoroon."</p>
<p>"So I larn.&nbsp; Yure rather more Roon than Octo, I take it,"
sed I, fur I never seed a puttier gal in the hull endoorin time of
my life.&nbsp; She had on a More Antic Barsk &amp; a Poplin Nubier
with Berage trimmins onto it, while her ise &amp; kurls was enuff
to make a man jump into a mill pond without biddin his relashuns
good-by.&nbsp; I pittid the Octoroon from the inmost recusses of my
hart &amp; hawled out 50 dollars kerslap, &amp; told her to buy her
old muther as soon as posserbul.&nbsp; Sez she "kine sir mutch
thanks."&nbsp; She then lade her hed over onto my showlder &amp;
sed I was "old rats."&nbsp; I was astonished to heer this
obsarvation, which I knowd was never used in refined society &amp;
I perlitely but emfattercly shovd her hed away.</p>
<p>Sez I "Marm, I'm trooly sirprized."</p>
<p>Sez she, "git out.&nbsp; Yure the nicist old man Ive seen
yit.&nbsp; Give us anuther 50!"&nbsp; Had a seleck assortment of
the most tremenjious thunderbolts descended down onto me I couldn't
hav bin more takin aback.&nbsp; I jumpt up, but she ceased my coat
tales &amp; in a wild voise cride, "No, Ile never desart
you&mdash;let us fli together to a furrin shoor!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "not mutch we wont," and I made a powerful effort to get
awa from her.&nbsp; "This is plade out," I sed, whereupon she jerkt
me back into the seet.&nbsp; "Leggo my coat, you scandaluss
female," I roared, when she set up the most unarthly yellin and
hollerin you ever heerd.&nbsp; The passinjers &amp; the gentlemunly
konducter rusht to the spot, &amp; I don't think I ever experiunsed
sich a rumpus in the hull coarse of my natral dase.&nbsp; The man
in black close rusht up to me &amp; sed "How dair yu insult my
neece, you horey heded vagabone.&nbsp; You base exhibbiter of low
wax figgers&mdash;yu woolf in sheep's close," &amp; sow 4th.</p>
<p>I was konfoozed.&nbsp; I was a loonytick fur the time bein, and
offered 5 dollars reward to enny gentleman of good morrul carracter
who wood tell me whot my name was &amp; what town I livd
into.&nbsp; The konducter kum to me &amp; sed the insultid parties
wood settle for 50 dollars, which I immejitly hawled out, &amp;
agane implored sumbuddy to state whare I was prinsipully, &amp; if
I shood be thare a grate while my self ef things went on as they'd
bin goin fur sum time back.&nbsp; I then axed if there was enny
more Octoroons present, "becawz," sez I, "ef there is, let um cum
along, fur Ime in the Octoroon bizniss."&nbsp; I then threw my
specterculs out of the winder, smasht my hat wildly down over my
Ise, larfed highsterically &amp; fell under a seet.&nbsp; I lay
there sum time &amp; fell asleep.&nbsp; I dreamt Mrs. Ward &amp;
the twins had bin carried orf by Ryenosserhosses &amp; that
Baldinsville had bin captered by a army of Octoroons.&nbsp; When I
awoked the lamps was a burnin dimly.&nbsp; Sum of the passinjers
was a snorein like pawpusses &amp; the little damsell in the pinc
gown was a singin "Oft in the Silly nite."&nbsp; The onprinsipuld
Octoroon &amp; the miserbul man in black close was gone, &amp; all
of a suddent it flasht ore my brane that I'de bin swindild.</p>

<br />
<p>About two years ago I arrove in Oberlin, Ohio.&nbsp; Oberlin is
whare the celebrated college is.&nbsp; In fack, Oberlin IS the
college, everything else in that air vicinity resolvin around
excloosivly for the benefit of that institution.&nbsp; It is a very
good college, too, &amp; a grate many wurthy yung men go there
annooally to git intelleck into 'em.&nbsp; But its my onbiassed
'pinion that they go it rather too strong on Ethiopians at
Oberlin.&nbsp; But that's nun of my bisniss.&nbsp; I'm into the
Show bizness.&nbsp; Yit as a faithful historan I must menshun the
fack that on rainy dase white peple can't find their way threw the
streets without the gas is lit, there bein such a numerosity of
cullerd pussons in the town.</p>
<p>As I was sayin, I arroved at Oberlin, and called on Perfesser
Peck for the purpuss of skewerin Kolonial Hall to exhibit my wax
works and beests of Pray into.&nbsp; Kolonial Hall is in the
college and is used by the stujents to speak peaces and read essays
into.</p>
<p>Sez Perfesser Peck, "Mister Ward, I don't know 'bout this
bizniss.&nbsp; What are your sentiments?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "I hain't got any."</p>
<p>"Good God!" cried the Perfesser, "did I understan you to say you
hav no sentiments!"</p>
<p>"Nary a sentiment!" sez I.</p>
<p>"Mister Ward, don't your blud bile at the thawt that three
million and a half of your culled brethren air a clankin their
chains in the South?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "Not a bile!&nbsp; Let 'em clank!"</p>
<p>He was about to continner his flowry speech when I put a stopper
on him.&nbsp; Sez I, "Perfesser Peck, A. Ward is my name &amp;
Americky is my nashun; I'm allers the same, tho' humble is my
station, and I've bin in the show bizniss goin on 22 years.&nbsp;
The pint is, can I hav your Hall by payin a fair price?&nbsp; You
air full of sentiments.&nbsp; That's your lay, while I'm a
exhibiter of startlin curiosities.&nbsp; What d'ye say?"</p>
<p>"Mister Ward, you air endowed with a hily practical mind, and
while I deeply regret that you air devoid of sentiments I'll let
you hav the hall provided your exhibition is of a moral &amp;
elevatin nater."</p>
<p>Sez I, "Tain't nothin shorter."</p>
<p>So I opened in Kolonial Hall, which was crowded every nite with
stujents, &amp;c.&nbsp; Perfesser Finny gazed for hours at my
Kangaroo, but when that sagashus but onprincipled little cuss set
up one of his onarthly yellins and I proceeded to hosswhip him, the
Perfesser objected.&nbsp; "Suffer not your angry pashums to rise up
at the poor annimil's little excentrissities," said the
Perfesser.</p>
<p>"Do you call such conduck as THOSE a little excentrissity?" I
axed.</p>
<p>"I do," sed he; sayin which he walked up to the cage and se zhe,
"let's try moral swashun upon the poor creeter."&nbsp; So he put
his hand upon the Kangeroo's hed and sed, "poor little
fellow&mdash;poor little fellow&mdash;your master is very crooil,
isn't he, my untootered frend," when the Kangaroo, with a terrific
yell, grabd the Perfesser by the hand and cum very near chawin it
orf.&nbsp; It was amoozin to see the Perfesser jump up and scream
with pane.&nbsp; Sez I, "that's one of the poor little fellow's
excentrissities!"</p>
<p>Sez he, "Mister Ward, that's a dangerous quadruped.&nbsp; He's
totally depraved.&nbsp; I will retire and do my lasserated hand up
in a rag, and meanwhile I request you to meat out summery and
severe punishment to the vishus beest," I hosswhipt the little cuss
for upwards of 15 minutes.&nbsp; Guess I licked sum of his
excentrissity out of him.</p>
<p>Oberlin is a grate plase.&nbsp; The College opens with a prayer
and then the New York Tribune is read.&nbsp; A kolleckshun is then
taken up to buy overkoats with red horn buttons onto them for the
indignant cullured people of Kanady.&nbsp; I have to contribit
librally two the glowrius work, as they kawl it hear.&nbsp; I'm
kompelled by the Fackulty to reserve front seets in my show for the
cullered peple.&nbsp; At the Boardin House the cullered peple sit
at the first table.&nbsp; What they leeve is maid into hash for the
white peple.&nbsp; As I don't like the idee of eatin my vittles
with Ethiopians, I sit at the seckind table, and the konsequence is
I've devowered so much hash that my inards is in a hily mixt up
condishun.&nbsp; Fish bones hav maid their appearance all over my
boddy and pertater peelins air a springin up through my hair.&nbsp;
Howsever I don't mind it.&nbsp; I'm gittin along well in a pecunery
pint of view.&nbsp; The College has konfired upon me the honery
title of T.K., of which I'm suffishuntly prowd.</p>

<p>Thare was many affectin ties which made me hanker arter Betsy
Jane.&nbsp; Her father's farm jined our'n; their cows and our'n
squencht their thurst at the same spring; our old mares both had
stars in their forreds; the measles broke out in both famerlies at
nearly the same period; our parients (Betsy's and mine) slept
reglarly every Sunday in the same meetin house, and the nabers used
to obsarve, "How thick the Wards and Peasleys air!"&nbsp; It was a
surblime site, in the Spring of the year, to see our sevral mothers
(Betsy's and mine) with their gowns pin'd up so thay couldn't sile
'em, affecshuntly Bilin sope together &amp; aboozin the nabers.</p>
<p>Altho I hankerd intensly arter the objeck of my affecshuns, I
darsunt tell her of the fires which was rajin in my manly
Buzzum.&nbsp; I'd try to do it but my tung would kerwollup up agin
the roof of my mowth &amp; stick thar, like deth to a deseast
Afrikan or a country postmaster to his offiss, while my hart
whanged agin my ribs like a old fashioned wheat Flale agin a barn
floor.</p>
<p>'Twas a carm still nite in Joon.&nbsp; All nater was husht and
nary a zeffer disturbed the sereen silens.&nbsp; I sot with Betsy
Jane on the fense of her farther's pastur.&nbsp; We'd bin rompin
threw the woods, kullin flours &amp; drivin the woodchuck from his
Nativ Lair (so to speak) with long sticks.&nbsp; Wall, we sot thar
on the fense, a swingin our feet two and fro, blushin as red as the
Baldinsville skool house when it was fust painted, and lookin very
simple, I make no doubt.&nbsp; My left arm was ockepied in
ballunsin myself on the fense, while my rite was woundid luvinly
round her waste.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat and tremblin sed, "Betsy, you're a
Gazelle."</p>
<p>I thought that air was putty fine.&nbsp; I waitid to see what
effeck it would hav upon her.&nbsp; It evidently didn't fetch her,
for she up and sed,</p>
<p>"You're a sheep!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "Betsy, I think very muchly of you."</p>
<p>"I don't b'leeve a word you say&mdash;so there now cum!" with
which obsarvashun she hitched away from me.</p>
<p>"I wish thar was winders to my Sole," sed I, "so that you could
see some of my feelins.&nbsp; There's fire enuff in here," sed I,
strikin my buzzum with my fist, "to bile all the corn beef and
turnips in the naberhood.&nbsp; Versoovius and the Critter ain't a
circumstans!"</p>
<p>She bowd her hed down and commenst chawin the strings to her sun
bonnet.</p>
<p>"Ar could you know the sleeplis nites I worry threw with on your
account, how vittles has seized to be attractiv to me &amp; how my
lims has shrunk up, you wouldn't dowt me.&nbsp; Gase on this wastin
form and these 'ere sunken cheeks"&mdash;</p>
<p>I should have continnered on in this strane probly for sum time,
but unfortnitly I lost my ballunse and fell over into the pastur
ker smash, tearin my close and seveerly damagin myself
ginerally.</p>
<p>Betsy Jane sprung to my assistance in dubble quick time and
dragged me 4th.&nbsp; Then drawin herself up to her full hite she
sed:</p>
<p>"I won't listen to your noncents no longer.&nbsp; Jes say rite
strate out what you're drivin at.&nbsp; If you mean gettin hitched,
I'M IN!"</p>
<p>I considered that air enuff for all practicul purpusses, and we
proceeded immejitely to the parson's, &amp; was made 1 that very

<p>On returnin to my humsted in Baldinsville, Injianny, resuntly,
my feller sitterzens extended a invite for me to norate to 'em on
the Krysis.&nbsp; I excepted &amp; on larst Toosday nite I peared
be4 a C of upturned faces in the Red Skool House.&nbsp; I spoke
nearly as follers:</p>
<p>Baldinsvillins: Hearto4, as I hav numerously obsarved, I have
abstrained from having any sentimunts or principles, my pollertics,
like my religion, bein of a exceedin accommodatin character.&nbsp;
But the fack can't be no longer disgised that a Krysis is onto us,
&amp; I feel it's my dooty to accept your invite for one
consecutive nite only.&nbsp; I spose the inflammertory individooals
who assisted in projucing this Krysis know what good she will do,
but I ain't 'shamed to state that I don't scacely.&nbsp; But the
Krysis is hear.&nbsp; She's bin hear for sevral weeks, &amp;
Goodness nose how long she'll stay.&nbsp; But I venter to assert
that she's rippin things.&nbsp; She's knockt trade into a cockt up
hat and chaned Bizness of all kinds tighter nor I ever chaned any
of my livin wild Beests.&nbsp; Alow me to hear dygress &amp; stait
that my Beests at presnt is as harmless as the newborn Babe.&nbsp;
Ladys &amp; gentlemen needn't hav no fears on that pint.&nbsp; To
resoom&mdash;Altho I can't exactly see what good this Krysis can
do, I can very quick say what the origernal cawz of her is.&nbsp;
The origernal cawz is Our Afrikan Brother.&nbsp; I was into
BARNIM'S Moozeum down to New York the other day &amp; saw that
exsentric Etheopian, the What Is It.&nbsp; Sez I, "Mister What Is
It, you folks air raisin thunder with this grate country.&nbsp;
You're gettin to be ruther more numeris than interestin.&nbsp; It
is a pity you coodent go orf sumwhares by yourselves, &amp; be a
nation of What Is Its, tho' if you'll excoose me, I shooden't care
about marryin among you.&nbsp; No dowt you're exceedin charmin to
hum, but your stile of luvliness isn't adapted to this cold
climit.&nbsp; He larfed into my face, which rather Riled me, as I
had been perfeckly virtoous and respectable in my
observashuns.&nbsp; So sez I, turnin a leetle red in the face, I
spect, "Do you hav the unblushin impoodents to say you folks
haven't raised a big mess of thunder in this brite land, Mister
What Is It?"&nbsp; He larfed agin, wusser nor be4, whareupon I up
and sez, "Go home, Sir, to Afriky's burnin shores &amp; taik all
the other What Is Its along with you.&nbsp; Don't think we can
spair your interestin picters.&nbsp; You What Is Its air on the
pint of smashin up the gratest Guv'ment ever erected by man, &amp;
you actooally hav the owdassity to larf about it.&nbsp; Go home,
you low cuss!"</p>
<p>I was workt up to a high pitch, &amp; I proceeded to a
Restorator &amp; cooled orf with some little fishes biled in
ile&mdash;I b'leeve thay call 'em sardeens.</p>
<p>Feller Sitterzuns, the Afrikan may be Our Brother.&nbsp; Sevral
hily respectyble gentlemen, and sum talentid females tell us so,
&amp; fur argyment's sake I mite be injooced to grant it, tho' I
don't beleeve it myself.&nbsp; But the Afrikan isn't our sister
&amp; our wife &amp; our uncle.&nbsp; He isn't sevral of our
brothers &amp; all our fust wife's relashuns.&nbsp; He isn't our
grandfather, and our grate grandfather, and our Aunt in the
country.&nbsp; Scacely.&nbsp; &amp; yit numeris persons would have
us think so.&nbsp; It's troo he runs Congress &amp; sevral other
public grosserys, but then he ain't everybody &amp; everybody else
likewise.&nbsp; [Notiss to bizness men of VANITY FAIR:&nbsp; Extry
charg fur this larst remark.&nbsp; It's a goak.&mdash;A.W.]</p>
<p>But we've got the Afrikan, or ruther he's got us, &amp; now what
air we going to do about it?&nbsp; He's a orful noosanse.&nbsp;
Praps he isn't to blame fur it.&nbsp; Praps he was creatid fur sum
wise purpuss, like the measles and New Englan Rum, but it's mity
hard to see it.&nbsp; At any rate he's no good here, &amp; as I
statid to Mister What Is It, it's a pity he cooden't go orf
sumwhares quietly by hisself, whare he cood wear red weskits &amp;
speckled neckties, &amp; gratterfy his ambishun in varis interestin
wase, without havin a eternal fuss kickt up about him.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/06.gif" alt=
"picture of Artemus on the lecture platform" />Praps I'm bearin
down too hard upon Cuffy.&nbsp; Cum to think on it, I am.&nbsp; He
woodn't be sich a infernal noosanse if white peple would let him
alone.&nbsp; He mite indeed be interestin.&nbsp; And now I think of
it, why can't the white peple let him alone.&nbsp; What's the good
of continnerly stirrin him up with a ten-foot pole?&nbsp; He isn't
the sweetest kind of Perfoomery when in a natral stait.</p>
<p>Feller Sitterzens, the Union's in danger.&nbsp; The black devil
Disunion is trooly here, starein us all squarely in the face!&nbsp;
We must drive him back.&nbsp; Shall we make a 2nd Mexico of
ourselves?&nbsp; Shall we sell our birthrite for a mess of
potash?&nbsp; Shall one brother put the knife to the throat of
anuther brother?&nbsp; Shall we mix our whisky with each other's
blud?&nbsp; Shall the star spangled Banner be cut up into
dishcloths?&nbsp; Standin here in this here Skoolhouse, upon my
nativ shor so to speak, I anser&mdash;Nary!</p>
<p>Oh you fellers who air raisin this row, &amp; who in the fust
place startid it, I'm 'shamed of you.&nbsp; The Showman blushes for
you, from his boots to the topmost hair upon his wenerable hed.</p>
<p>Feller Sitterzens: I am in the Sheer &amp; Yeller leaf.&nbsp; I
shall peg out 1 of these dase.&nbsp; But while I do stop here I
shall stay in the Union.&nbsp; I know not what the supervizers of
Baldinsville may conclude to do, but for one, I shall stand by the
Stars &amp; Stripes.&nbsp; Under no circumstances whatsomever will
I sesesh.&nbsp; Let every Stait in the Union sesesh &amp; let
Palmetter flags flote thicker nor shirts on Square Baxter's close
line, still will I stick to the good old flag.&nbsp; The country
may go to the devil, but I won't!&nbsp; And next Summer when I
start out on my campane with my Show, wharever I pitch my little
tent, you shall see floatin prowdly from the center pole thereof
the Amerikan Flag, with nary a star wiped out, nary a stripe less,
but the same old flag that has allers flotid thar! &amp; the price
of admishun will be the same it allers was&mdash;15 cents, children
half price.</p>

and not fit to be patrernized by peplpeple of high degree.&nbsp;
Sirs, I manetane that this is infernul nonsense.&nbsp; I manetane
that wax figgers is more elevatin than awl the plays ever
wroten.&nbsp; Take Shakespeer for instunse.&nbsp; Peple think heze
grate things, but I kontend heze quite the reverse to the
kontrary.&nbsp; What sort of sense is thare to King Leer, who goze
round cussin his darters, chawin hay and throin straw at folks, and
larfin like a silly old koot and makin a ass of hisself
ginerally?&nbsp; Thare's Mrs. Mackbeth&mdash;sheze a nise kind of
woomon to have round ain't she, a puttin old Mack, her husband, up
to slayin Dunkan with a cheeze knife, while heze payin a frendly
visit to their house.&nbsp; O its hily morral, I spoze, when she
larfs wildly and sez, "gin me the daggurs&mdash;Ile let his bowels
out," or wurds to that effeck&mdash;I say, this is awl, strickly,
propper I spoze?&nbsp; That Jack Fawlstarf is likewise a immoral
old cuss, take him how ye may, and Hamlick is as crazy as a
loon.&nbsp; Thare's Richurd the Three, peple think heze grate
things, but I look upon him in the lite of a monkster.&nbsp; He
kills everybody he takes a noshun to in kold blud, and then goze to
sleep in his tent.&nbsp; Bimeby he wakes up and yells for a hoss so
he kan go orf and kill some more peple.&nbsp; If he isent a fit
spesserman for the gallers then I shood like to know whare you find
um.&nbsp; Thare's Iargo who is more ornery nor pizun.&nbsp; See how
shameful he treated that hily respecterble injun gentlemun, Mister
Otheller, makin him for to beleeve his wife was too thick with
Casheo.&nbsp; Obsarve how Iargo got Casheo drunk as a biled owl on
corn whiskey in order to karry out his sneekin desines.&nbsp; See
how he wurks Mister Otheller's feelins up so that he goze and makes
poor Desdemony swaller a piller which cawses her deth.&nbsp; But I
must stop.&nbsp; At sum futur time I shall continner my remarks on
the drammer in which I shall show the varst supeeriority of wax
figgers and snakes over theater plays, in a interlectooal pint of
view.</p>

</center>
<br />
<p>(Some queer people, calling themselves "Free Lovers," and
possessing very original ideas about life and morality, established
themselves at Berlin Heights, in Ohio, a few years since.&nbsp;
Public opinion was resistlessly against them, however, and the
association was soon disbanded.)</p>
<p>Some years ago I pitched my tent and onfurled my banner to the
breeze, in Berlin Hites, Ohio.&nbsp; I had hearn that Berlin Hites
was ockepied by a extensive seck called Free Lovers, who beleeved
in affinertys and sich, goin back on their domestic ties without no
hesitation whatsomever.&nbsp; They was likewise spirit rappers and
high presher reformers on gineral principles.&nbsp; If I can
improve these 'ere misgided peple by showin them my onparalleld
show at the usual low price of admitants, methunk, I shell not hav
lived in vane.&nbsp; But bitterly did I cuss the day I ever sot
foot in the retchid place.&nbsp; I sot up my tent in a field near
the Love Cure, as they called it, and bimeby the free lovers begun
for to congregate around the door.&nbsp; A onreer set I have never
sawn.&nbsp; The men's faces was all covered with hare and they
lookt half-starved to deth.&nbsp; They didn't wear no weskuts for
the purpose (as they sed) of allowin the free air of hevun to blow
onto their boozums.&nbsp; Their pockets was filled with tracks and
pamplits and they was bare-footed.&nbsp; They sed the Postles
didn't wear boots, &amp; why should they?&nbsp; That was their
stile of argyment.&nbsp; The wimin was wuss than the men.&nbsp;
They wore trowsis, short gownds, straw hats with green ribbins, and
all carried bloo cotton umbrellers.</p>
<p>Presently a perfeckly orful lookin female presented herself at
the door.&nbsp; Her gownd was skanderlusly short and her trowsis
was shameful to behold.</p>
<p>She eyed me over very sharp, and then startin back she sed, in a
wild voice:</p>
<p>"Ah, can it be?"</p>
<p>"Which?" sed I.</p>
<p>"Yes, 'tis troo, O 'tis troo!"</p>
<p>"15 cents, marm," I anserd.</p>
<p>She bust out a cryin &amp; sed:</p>
<p>"And so I hav found you at larst&mdash;at larst, O at
larst!"</p>
<p>"Yes," I anserd, "you hav found me at larst, and you would hav
found me at fust, if you had cum sooner."</p>
<p>She grabd me vilently by the coat collar, and brandishin her
umbreller wildly round, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Air you a man?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "I think I air, but if you doubt it, you can address Mrs.
A. Ward, Baldinsville, Injianny, postage pade, &amp; she will
probly giv you the desired informashun."</p>
<p>"Then thou ist what the cold world calls marrid?"</p>
<p>"Madam, I istest!"</p>
<p>The exsentric female then clutched me franticly by the arm and
hollered:</p>
<p>"You air mine, O you air mine!"</p>
<p>"Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her.&nbsp; But she
clung to me and sed:</p>
<p>"You air my Affinerty!"</p>
<p>"What upon arth is that?" I shouted.</p>
<p>"Dost thou not know?"</p>
<p>"No, I dostent!"</p>
<p>"Listin man, &amp; I'll tell ye!" sed the strange female; "for
years I hav yearned for thee.&nbsp; I knowd thou wast in the world,
sumwhares, tho I didn't know whare.&nbsp; My hart sed he would cum
and I took courage.&nbsp; He HAS cum&mdash;he's here&mdash;you air
him&mdash;you air my Affinerty! O 'tis too mutch! too mutch!" and
she sobbed agin.</p>
<p>"Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn site too mutch!"</p>
<p>"Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin her hands
like a female play acter.</p>
<p>"Not a yearn!" I bellerd at the top of my voice, throwin her
away from me.</p>
<p>The free lovers who was standin round obsarvin the scene
commenst for to holler "shame" "beast," etsettery, etsettery.</p>
<p>I was very mutch riled, and fortifyin myself with a spare tent
stake, I addrest them as follers:</p>
<p>"You pussylanermus critters, go way from me and take this
retchid woman with you.&nbsp; I'm a law-abidin man, and beleeve in
good, old-fashioned institutions.&nbsp; I am marrid &amp; my
orfsprings resemble me if I am a showman!&nbsp; I think your
Affinity bizniss is cussed noncents, besides bein outrajusly
wicked.&nbsp; Why don't you behave desunt like other folks?&nbsp;
Go to work and earn a honist livin and not stay round here in this
lazy, shiftless way, pizenin the moral atmosphere with your
pestifrous ideas!&nbsp; You wimin folks go back to your lawful
husbands if you've got any, and take orf them skanderlous gownds
and trowsis, and dress respectful like other wimin.&nbsp; You men
folks, cut orf them pirattercal whiskers, burn up them infurnel
pamplits, put sum weskuts on, go to work choppin wood, splittin
fence rales, or tillin the sile."&nbsp; I pored 4th my indignashun
in this way till I got out of breth, when I stopt.&nbsp; I shant go
to Berlin Hites agin, not if I live to be as old as
Methooseler.</p>

<br />
<p>It is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well remember, since
I crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the Brite land of Jold.&nbsp;
While crossin the Planes all so bold I fell in with sum noble red
men of the forest (N.B.&nbsp; This is rote Sarcasticul.&nbsp;
Injins is Pizin, whar ever found,) which thay Sed I was their
Brother, &amp; wanted for to smoke the Calomel of Peace with
me.&nbsp; Thay then stole my jerkt beef, blankits, etsettery,
skalpt my orgin grinder &amp; scooted with a Wild Hoop.&nbsp; Durin
the Cheaf's techin speech he sed he shood meet me in the Happy
Huntin Grounds.&nbsp; If he duz thare will be a fite.&nbsp; But
enuff of this ere.&nbsp; <i>Reven Noose Muttons</i>, as our
skoolmaster, who has got Talent into him, cussycally obsarve.</p>
<p>I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time.&nbsp; At Camp Scott there was
a lot of U.S. sogers, hosstensibly sent out there to smash the
Mormons but really to eat Salt vittles &amp; play poker &amp; other
beautiful but sumwhat onsartin games.&nbsp; I got acquainted with
sum of the officers.&nbsp; Thay lookt putty scrumpshus in their
Bloo coats with brass buttings onto um &amp; ware very talented
drinkers, but so fur as fitin is consarned I'd willingly put my wax
figgers agin the hull party.</p>
<p>My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake City, so I
called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung the mormins and axed
his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my banner to the jentle
breezis.&nbsp; He lookt at me in a austeer manner for a few minits,
and sed:</p>
<p>"Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the immaculateness of the
Mormin Church and the Latter-day Revelashuns?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "I'm on it!"&nbsp; I make it a pint to git along plesunt,
tho I didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin
at.&nbsp; He sed I mite show.</p>
<p>"You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?" sez I, preparin
to rite him sum free parsis.</p>
<p>"I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward.&nbsp; I sertinly am
married."</p>
<p>"How do you like it as far as you hev got?" sed I.</p>
<p>He sed "middlin," and axed me wouldn't I like to see his
famerly, to which I replide that I wouldn't mine minglin with the
fair Seck &amp; Barskin in the winnin smiles of his interestin
wives.&nbsp; He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.&nbsp; The house
is powerful big &amp; in a exceedin large room was his wives &amp;
children, which larst was squawkin and hollerin enuff to take the
roof rite orf the house.&nbsp; The wimin was of all sizes and
ages.&nbsp; Sum was pretty &amp; sum was Plane&mdash;sum was helthy
and sum was on the Wayne&mdash;which is verses, tho sich was not my
intentions, as I don't 'prove of puttin verses in Proze rittins,
tho ef occashun requires I can Jerk a Poim ekal to any of them
Atlantic Munthly fellers.</p>
<p>"My wives, Mister Ward," sed Yung.</p>
<p>"Your sarvant, marms," sed I, as I sot down in a cheer which a
red-heded female brawt me.</p>
<p>"Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward," sed Yung, "I
hav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated land which air
Sealed to me."</p>
<p>"Which?" sez I, gittin up &amp; starin at him.</p>
<p>"Sealed, Sir! sealed."</p>
<p>"Whare bowts?" sez I.</p>
<p>"I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!"&nbsp; He spoke in a
traggerdy voice.</p>
<p>"Will they probly continner on in that stile to any grate
extent, Sir?" I axed.</p>
<p>"Sir," sed he, turnin as red as a biled beet, "don't you know
that the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit, may hev as meny
wives as I wants?"</p>
<p>"Jes so," I sed.&nbsp; "You are old pie, ain't you?"</p>
<p>"Them as is Sealed to me&mdash;that is to say, to be mine when I
wants um&mdash;air at present my sperretooul wives," sed Mister
Yung.</p>
<p>"Long may thay wave!" sez I, seein I shood git into a scrape ef
I didn't look out.</p>
<p>In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the follerin
fax:&nbsp; It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives.&nbsp; He don't
do it only onct a yere &amp; sez it is wuss nor cleanin
house.&nbsp; He don't pretend to know his children, thare is so
many of um, tho they all know him.&nbsp; He sez about every child
he meats call him Par, &amp; he takes it for grantid it is
so.&nbsp; His wives air very expensiv.&nbsp; Thay allers want
suthin &amp; ef he don't buy it for um thay set the house in a
uproar.&nbsp; He sez he don't have a minit's peace.&nbsp; His wives
fite amung their selves so much that he has bilt a fitin room for
thare speshul benefit, &amp; when too of 'em get into a row he has
em turnd loose into that place, whare the dispoot is settled
accordin to the rules of the London prize ring.&nbsp; Sum times
thay abooz hisself individooally.&nbsp; Thay hev pulled the most of
his hair out at the roots &amp; he wares meny a horrible scar upon
his body, inflicted with mop-handles, broom-sticks, and sich.&nbsp;
Occashunly they git mad &amp; scald him with bilin hot water.&nbsp;
When he got eny waze cranky thay'd shut him up in a dark closit,
previsly whippin him arter the stile of muthers when thare
orfsprings git onruly.&nbsp; Sumptimes when he went in swimmin
thay'd go to the banks of the Lake &amp; steal all his close,
thereby compellin him to sneek home by a sircootius rowt, drest in
the Skanderlus stile of the Greek Slaiv.&nbsp; "I find that the
keers of a marrid life way hevy onto me," sed the Profit, "&amp;
sumtimes I wish I'd remaned singel."&nbsp; I left the Profit and
startid for the tavern whare I put up to.&nbsp; On my way I was
overtuk by a lurge krowd of Mormons, which they surroundid me &amp;
statid that they were goin into the Show free.</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "ef I find a individooal who is goin round lettin
folks into his show free, I'll let you know."</p>
<p>"We've had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Wards's Show
without payin nothin!" thay showtid.</p>
<p>"Yes," hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me by the
cote tales &amp; swingin me round very rapid, "we're all goin in
free!&nbsp; So sez the Revelashun!"</p>
<p>"What's Old Revelashun got to do with my show?" sez I, gittin
putty rily.&nbsp; "Tell Mister Revelashun," sed I, drawin myself up
to my full hite and lookin round upon the ornery krowd with a prowd
&amp; defiant mean, "tell Mister Revelashun to mind his own
bizness, subject only to the Konstitushun of the United
States!"</p>
<p>"Oh now let us in, that's a sweet man," sed several femails,
puttin thare arms round me in luvin style.&nbsp; "Become 1 of
us.&nbsp; Becum a Preest &amp; hav wives Sealed to you."</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/07.gif" alt=
"picture of Artemus and the Mormom ladies" />"Not a Seal!" sez I,
startin back in horror at the idee.</p>
<p>"Oh stay, Sir, stay," sed a tell, gawnt femaile, ore whoos hed
37 summirs must hev parsd, "stay, &amp; I'll be your Jentle
Gazelle."</p>
<p>"Not ef I know it, you won't," sez I.&nbsp; "Awa you skanderlus
femaile, awa!&nbsp; Go &amp; be a Nunnery!" <i>That's what I sed,
jes so</i>.</p>
<p>"&amp; I," sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade more than
too hundred lbs, "I will be your sweet gidin Star!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "Ile bet two dollers and a half you won't!"&nbsp; Whare
ear I may Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy Jane!&nbsp; [N.B.
Betsy Jane is my wife's Sir naime.]</p>
<p>"Wiltist thou not tarry here in the promist Land?" sed several
of the miserabil critters.</p>
<p>"Ile see you all essenshally cussed be4 I wiltist!" roared I, as
mad as I cood be at thare infernul noncents.&nbsp; I girdid up my
Lions &amp; fled the Seen.&nbsp; I packt up my duds &amp; Left Salt
Lake, which is a 2nd Soddum &amp; Germorrer, inhabitid by as
theavin &amp; onprincipled a set of retchis as ever drew Breth in

<p>Durin a recent visit to New York the undersined went to see
Edwin Forrest.&nbsp; As I'm into the moral show bizness myself, I
ginrally go to Barnum's moral Museum, where only moral peple air
admitted, pertickly on Wednesday arternoons.&nbsp; But this time I
thot I'd go &amp; see Ed.&nbsp; Ed has bin actin out on the stage
for many years.&nbsp; There is varis 'pinions about his actin,
Englishmen ginrally bleevin that he is far superior to Mister
Macready; but on one pint all agree, &amp; that is that Ed draws
like a six ox team.&nbsp; Ed was actin at Niblo's Garding, which
looks considerable more like a parster, than a garding, but let
that pars.&nbsp; I sot down in the pit, took out my spectacles
&amp; commenced peroosin the evenin's bill.&nbsp; The awjince was
all-fired large &amp; the boxes was full of the elitty of New
York.&nbsp; Several opery glasses was leveld at me by Gothum's
farest darters, but I didn't let on as tho I noticed it, tho mebby
I did take out my sixteen-dollar silver watch &amp; brandish it
round more than was necessary.&nbsp; But the best of us has our
weaknesses &amp; if a man has gewelry let him show it.&nbsp; As I
was peroosin the bill a grave young man who sot near me axed me if
I'd ever seen Forrest dance the Essence of Old
Virginny?&nbsp;<img align="left" src="images/08.gif" alt=
"picture of Artemus and the young man" /> "He's immense in that,"
sed the young man.&nbsp; "He also does a fair champion jig," the
young man continnerd, "but his Big Thing is the Essence of Old
Virginny."&nbsp; Sez I, "Fair youth, do you know what I'd do with
you if you was my sun?"</p>
<br />
<p>"No," sez he.</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "I'd appint your funeral tomorrow arternoon,
&amp; the KORPS SHOULD BE READY!&nbsp; You're too smart to live on
this yearth."&nbsp; He didn't try any more of his capers on
me.&nbsp; But another pussylanermus individooul, in a red vest
&amp; patent lether boots, told me his name was Bill Astor &amp;
axed me to lend him 50 cents till early in the mornin.&nbsp; I told
him I'd probly send it round to him before he retired to his
virtoous couch, but if I didn't he might look for it next fall, as
soon as I cut my corn.&nbsp; The Orchestry was now fiddling with
all their might, &amp; as the peple didn't understan anything about
it they applaudid versifrussly.&nbsp; Presently, Old Ed cum
out.&nbsp; The play was Otheller or More of Veniss.&nbsp; Otheller
was writ by Wm. Shakspeer.&nbsp; The scene is laid in Veniss.&nbsp;
Otheller was a likely man &amp; was a ginral in the Veniss
army.&nbsp; He eloped with Desdemony, a darter of the Hon. Mister
Brabantio, who represented one of the back districks in the
Veneshun legislater.&nbsp; Old Brabantio was as mad as thunder at
this &amp; tore round considerable, but finally cooled down, tellin
Otheller, howsever, that Desdemony had come it over her Par, &amp;
that he had better look out or she'd come it over him
likewise.&nbsp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Otheller git along very comfortable
like for a spell.&nbsp; She is sweet-tempered and luvin&mdash;a
nice, sensible female, never goin in for he-female conventions,
green cotton umbrellers, and pickled beats.&nbsp; Otheller is a
good provider and thinks all the world of his wife.&nbsp; She has a
lazy time of it, the hired girl doin all the cookin and
washin.&nbsp; Desdemony, in fact, don't have to git the water to
wash her own hands with.&nbsp; But a low cuss named Iago, who I
bleeve wants to git Otheller out of his snug government birth, now
goes to work &amp; upsets the Otheller family in the most outrajus
stile.&nbsp; Iago falls in with a brainless youth named Roderigo
&amp; wins all his money at poker.&nbsp; (Iago allers played
foul.)&nbsp; He thus got money enuff to carry out his onprincipled
skeem.&nbsp; Mike Cassio, a Irishman, is selected as a tool by
Iago.&nbsp; Mike was a clever feller &amp; orficer in Otheller's
army.&nbsp; He liked his tods too well, howsever, &amp; they
floored him, as they have many other promisin young men.&nbsp; Iago
injuces Mike to drink with him, Iago slyly throwin his whiskey over
his shoulder.&nbsp; Mike gits as drunk as a biled owl &amp; allows
that he can lick a yard full of the Veneshun fancy before
breakfast, without sweatin a hair.&nbsp; He meets Roderigo &amp;
proceeds for to smash him.&nbsp; A feller named Montano undertakes
to slap Cassio, when that infatooated person runs his sword into
him.&nbsp; That miserble man, Iago, pretents to be very sorry to
see Mike conduck hisself in this way &amp; undertakes to smooth the
thing over to Otheller, who rushes in with a drawn sword &amp;
wants to know what's up.&nbsp; Iago cunningly tells his story,
&amp; Otheller tells Mike that he thinks a good deal of him, but he
can't train no more in his regiment.&nbsp; Desdemony sympathizes
with poor Mike &amp; interceeds for him with Otheller.&nbsp; Iago
makes him bleeve she does this because she thinks more of Mike than
she does of hisself.&nbsp; Otheller swallers Iago's lyin tail &amp;
goes to makin a noosence of hisself ginrally.&nbsp; He worries poor
Desdemony terrible by his vile insinuations, &amp; finally smothers
her to deth with a piller.&nbsp; Mrs. Iago cums in just as Otheller
has finished the fowl deed &amp; givs him fits right &amp; left,
showin him that he has bin orfully gulled by her miserble cuss of a
husband.&nbsp; Iago cums in, &amp; his wife commences rakin him
down also, when he stabs her.&nbsp; Otheller jaws him a spell &amp;
then cuts a small hole in his stummick with his sword.&nbsp; Iago
pints to Desdemony's deth bed &amp; goes orf with a sardonic smile
onto his countenance.&nbsp; Otheller tells the peple that he has
dun the state sum service &amp; they know it; axes them to do as
fair a thing as they can for him under the circumstances, &amp;
kills hisself with a fish-knife, which is the most sensible thing
he can do.&nbsp; This is a breef skedule of the synopsis of the
play.</p>
<p>Edwin Forrest is a grate acter.&nbsp; I thot I saw Otheller
before me all the time he was actin, &amp; when the curtin fell, I
found my spectacles was still mistened with salt-water, which had
run from my eyes while poor Desdemony was dyin.&nbsp; Betsy
Jane&mdash;Betsy Jane!&nbsp; let us pray that our domestic bliss
may never be busted up by a Iago!</p>
<p>Edwin Forrest makes money actin out on the stage.&nbsp; He gits
five-hundred dollars a nite &amp; his board &amp; washin.&nbsp; I
wish I had such a Forrest in my Garding!</p>

POPULAR LECTURES.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>I feel that the Show Bizniss, which Ive stroven to ornyment, is
bein usurpt by Poplar Lecturs, as thay air kalled, tho in my pinion
thay air poplar humbugs.&nbsp; Individoouls, who git hard up,
embark in the lecturin biznis.&nbsp; They cram theirselves with
hi-sounding frazis, frizzle up their hare, git trustid for a soot
of black close &amp; cum out to lectur at 50 dollers a pop.&nbsp;
Thay aint over stockt with branes, but thay hav brass enuff to make
suffishunt kittles to bile all the sope that will be required by
the ensooin sixteen ginerashuns.&nbsp; Peple flock to heer um in
krowds.&nbsp; The men go becawz its poplar &amp; the wimin folks go
to see what other wimin folks have on.&nbsp; When its over the
lecturer goze &amp; ragales hisself with oysters and sich, while
the peple say, "What a charmin lectur that air was," etsettery,
etsettery, when 9 out of 10 of um don't have no moore idee of what
the lecturer sed than my kangeroo has of the sevunth speer of
hevun.&nbsp; Thare's moore infurmashun to be gut out of a well
conductid noospape&mdash;price 3 sents&mdash;than thare is out of
ten poplar lectures at 25 or 50 dollers a pop, as the kase may
be.&nbsp; These same peple, bare in mind, stick up their nosis at
moral wax figgers &amp; sagashus beests.&nbsp; Thay say these
things is low.&nbsp; Gents, it greeves my hart in my old age, when
I'm in "the Sheer &amp; yeller leef" (to cote frum my Irish frend
Mister McBeth) to see that the Show biznis is pritty much plade
out; howsomever I shall chance it agane in the Spring.</p>

<p>I pitcht my tent in a small town in Injianny one day last
seeson, &amp; while I was standin at the dore takin money, a
deppytashun of ladies came up &amp; sed they wos members of the
Bunkumville Female Moral Reformin &amp; Wimin's Rite's Associashun,
and thay axed me if they cood go in without payin.</p>
<p>"Not exactly," sez I, "but you can pay without goin in."</p>
<p>"Dew you know who we air?" sed one of the wimin&mdash;a tall and
feroshus lookin critter, with a blew kotton umbreller under her
arm&mdash;"do you know who we air, Sir?"</p>
<p>"My impreshun is," sed I, "from a kersery view, that you air
females."</p>
<p>"We air, Sur," sed the feroshus woman&mdash;"we belong to a
Society whitch beleeves wimin has rites&mdash;whitch beleeves in
razin her to her proper speer&mdash;whitch beleeves she is indowed
with as much intelleck as man is&mdash;whitch beleeves she is
trampled on and aboozed&mdash;&amp; who will resist henso4th &amp;
forever the incroachments of proud &amp; domineering men."</p>
<p>Durin her discourse, the exsentric female grabed me by the
coat-kollor &amp; was swinging her umbreller wildly over my
hed.</p>
<p>"I hope, marm," sez I, starting back, "that your intensions is
honorable!&nbsp; I'm a lone man hear in a strange place.&nbsp;
Besides, I've a wife to hum."</p>
<p>"Yes," cried the female, "&amp; she's a slave!&nbsp; Doth she
never dream of freedom&mdash;doth she never think of throwin off
the yoke of tyrrinny &amp; thinkin &amp; votin for
herself?&mdash;Doth she never think of these here things?"</p>
<p>"Not bein a natral born fool," sed I, by this time a little
riled, "I kin safely say that she dothunt."</p>
<p>"Oh whot&mdash;whot!" screamed the female, swingin her umbreller
in the air.&mdash;"O, what is the price that woman pays for her
expeeriunce!"</p>
<p>"I don't know," sez I; "the price of my show is 15 cents pur
individooal."</p>
<p>"&amp; can't our Soisety go in free?" asked the female.</p>
<p>"Not if I know it," sed I.</p>
<p>"Crooil, crooil man!" she cried, &amp; bust into teers.</p>
<p>"Won't you let my darter in?" sed anuther of the exsentric
wimin, taken me afeckshunitely by the hand.&nbsp; "O, please let my
darter in,&mdash;shee's a sweet gushin child of natur."</p>
<p>"Let her gush!" roared I, as mad as I cood stick at their tarnal
nonsense; "let her gush!"&nbsp; Where upon they all sprung back
with the simultanious observashun that I was a Beest.</p>
<p>"My female friends," sed I, "be4 you leeve, I've a few remarks
to remark; wa them well.&nbsp; The female woman is one of the
greatest institooshuns of which this land can boste.&nbsp; Its
onpossible to get along without her.&nbsp; Had there bin no female
wimin in the world, I should scarcely be here with my unparalleld
show on this very occashun.&nbsp; She is good in
sickness&mdash;good in wellness&mdash;good all the time.&nbsp; O
woman, woman!" I cried, my feelins worked up to a hi poetick pitch,
"you air a angle when you behave yourself; but when you take off
your proper appairel &amp; (mettyforically speaken)&mdash;get into
pantyloons&mdash;when you desert your firesides, &amp; with your
heds full of wimin's rites noshuns go round like roarin lions,
seekin whom you may devour someboddy&mdash;in short, when you
undertake to play the man, you play the devil and air an emfatic
noosance.&nbsp; My female friends," I continnered, as they were
indignantly departin, "wa well what A. Ward has sed!"</p>

<p>To my friends of the Editorial Corpse:</p>
<p>I rite these lines on British sile.&nbsp; I've bin follerin Mrs.
Victory's hopeful sun Albert Edward threw Kanady with my
onparaleled Show, and tho I haint made much in a pecoonary pint of
vew, I've lernt sumthin new, over hear on British Sile, whare they
bleeve in Saint George and the Dragoon.&nbsp; Previs to cumin over
hear I tawt my organist how to grind Rule Brittany and other airs
which is poplar on British Sile.&nbsp; I likewise fixt a wax figger
up to represent Sir Edmun Hed the Govner Ginral.&nbsp; The statoot
I fixt up is the most versytile wax statoot I ever saw.&nbsp; I've
showd it as Wm. Penn, Napoleon Bonypart, Juke of Wellington, the
Beneker Boy, Mrs. Cunningham &amp; varis other notid persons, and
also for a sertin pirut named Hix.&nbsp; I've bin so long amung wax
statoots that I can fix 'em up to soot the tastes of folks, &amp;
with sum paints I hav I kin giv their facis a beneverlent or
fiendish look as the kase requires.&nbsp; I giv Sir Edmun Hed a
beneverlent look, &amp; when sum folks who thawt they was smart sed
it didn't look like Sir Edmun Hed anymore than it did anybody else,
I sed, "That's the pint.&nbsp; That's the beauty of the
Statoot.&nbsp; It looks like Sir Edmun Hed or any other man.&nbsp;
You may kall it what you pleese. Ef it don't look like anybody that
ever lived, then it's sertinly a remarkable Statoot &amp; well
worth seein.&nbsp; <i>I</i> kall it Sir Edmun Hed.&nbsp; <i>You</i>
may kall it what you pleese!"&nbsp; [I had 'em thare.]</p>
<p>At larst I've had a interview with the Prince, tho it putty nigh
cost me my vallerble life.&nbsp; I cawt a glimpse of him as he sot
on the Pizarro of the hotel in Sarnia, &amp; elbowd myself threw a
crowd of wimin, children, sojers &amp; Injins that was hangin round
the tavern.&nbsp; I was drawin near to the Prince when a red-faced
man in Millingtery close grabd holt of me and axed me whare I was
goin all so bold?</p>
<p>"To see Albert Edard the Prince of Wales," sez I; "who are
you?"</p>
<p>He sed he was Kurnel of the Seventy Fust Regiment, Her Magisty's
troops.&nbsp; I told him I hoped the Seventy Onesters was in good
helth, and was passin by when he ceased hold of me agin, and sed in
a tone of indigent cirprise:</p>
<p>"What?&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; It kannot be!&nbsp; Blarst my
hize, sir, did I understan you to say that you was actooally goin
into the presents of his Royal Iniss?"</p>
<p>"That's what's the matter with me," I replide.</p>
<p>"But blarst my hize, sir, its onprecedented.&nbsp; It's orful,
sir. Nothin' like it hain't happened sins the Gun Powder Plot of
Guy Forks.&nbsp; Owdashus man, who air you?"</p>
<p>"Sir," sez I, drawin myself up &amp; puttin on a defiant air,
"I'm a Amerycan sitterzen.&nbsp; My name is Ward.&nbsp; I'm a
husband &amp; the father of twins, which I'm happy to state thay
look like me.&nbsp; By perfeshun I'm a exhibiter of wax works &amp;
sich."</p>
<p>"Good God!" yelled the Kurnal, "the idee of a exhibiter of wax
figgers goin into the presents of Royalty!&nbsp; The British Lion
may well roar with raje at the thawt!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "Speakin of the British Lion, Kurnal, I'd like to make a
bargin with you fur that beast fur a few weeks to add to my
Show."&nbsp; I didn't meen nothin by this.&nbsp; I was only gettin
orf a goak, but you roter hev seen the Old Kurnal jump up &amp;
howl.&nbsp; He actooally fomed at the mowth.</p>
<p>"This can't be real," he showtid.&nbsp; "No, no.&nbsp; It's a
horrid dream.&nbsp; Sir, you air not a human bein&mdash;you hav no
existents&mdash;yure a Myth!"</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "old hoss, yule find me a ruther onkomfortable
Myth ef you punch my inards in that way agin."&nbsp; I began to git
a little riled, fur when he called me a Myth he puncht me putty
hard.&nbsp; The Kurnal now commenst showtin fur the Seventy
Onesters.&nbsp; I at fust thawt I'd stay &amp; becum a Marter to
British Outraje, as sich a course mite git my name up &amp; be a
good advertisement fur my Show, but it occurred to me that ef enny
of the Seventy Onesters shood happen to insert a barronet into my
stummick it mite be onplesunt, &amp; I was on the pint of runnin
orf when the Prince hisself kum up &amp; axed me what the matter
was.&nbsp; Sez I, "Albert Edard, is that you?" &amp; he smilt &amp;
sed it was.&nbsp; Sez I, "Albert Edard, hears my keerd.&nbsp; I cum
to pay my respecks to the futer King of Ingland.&nbsp; The Kurnal
of the Seventy Onesters hear is ruther smawl pertaters, but of
course you ain't to blame fur that.&nbsp; He puts on as many airs
as tho he was the Bully Boy with the glass eye."</p>
<p>"Never mind," sez Albert Edard, "I'm glad to see you, Mister
Ward, at all events," &amp; he tuk my hand so plesunt like &amp;
larfed so sweet that I fell in love with him to onct.&nbsp; He
handid me a segar &amp; we sot down on the Pizarro &amp; commenst
smokin rite cheerful.&nbsp; "Wall," sez I, "Albert Edard, how's the
old folks?"</p>
<p>"Her Majesty &amp; the Prince are well," he sed.</p>
<p>"Duz the old man take his Lager beer reglar?" I inquired.</p>
<p>The Prince larfed &amp; intermatid that the old man didn't let
many kegs of that bevridge spile in the sellar in the coarse of a
year.&nbsp; We sot &amp; tawked there sum time abowt matters &amp;
things, &amp; bimeby I axed him how he liked bein Prince as fur as
he'd got.</p>
<p>"To speak plain, Mister Ward," he sed, "I don't much like
it.&nbsp; I'm sick of all this bowin &amp; scrapin &amp; crawlin
&amp; hurrain over a boy like me.&nbsp; I would rather go through
the country quietly &amp; enjoy myself in my own way, with the
other boys, &amp; not be made a Show of to be garped at by
everybody.&nbsp; When the PEPLE cheer me I feel pleesed, fur I know
they meen it; but if these one-horse offishuls cood know how I see
threw all their moves &amp; understan exackly what they air after,
&amp; knowd how I larft at 'em in private, thayd stop kissin my
hands &amp; fawnin over me as thay now do.&nbsp; But you know, Mr.
Ward, I can't help bein a Prince, &amp; I must do all I kin to fit
myself fur the persishun I must sumtime ockepy."</p>
<p>"That's troo," sez I; "sickness and the docters will carry the
Queen orf one of these dase, sure's yer born."</p>
<p>The time hevin arove fur me to take my departer I rose up &amp;
sed: "Albert Edard, I must go, but previs to doin so I will obsarve
that you soot me.&nbsp; Yure a good feller, Albert Edard, &amp; tho
I'm agin Princes as a gineral thing, I must say I like the cut of
your Gib.&nbsp; When you git to be King try and be as good a man as
yure muther has bin!&nbsp; Be just &amp; be Jenerus, espeshully to
showmen, who hav allers bin aboozed sins the dase of Noah, who was
the fust man to go into the Menagery bizniss, &amp; ef the daily
papers of his time air to be beleeved Noah's colleckshun of livin
wild beests beet ennything ever seen sins, tho I make bold to dowt
ef his snaiks was ahead of mine.&nbsp; Albert Edard, adoo!"&nbsp; I
tuk his hand which he shook warmly, &amp; givin him a perpetooal
free pars to my show, &amp; also parses to take hum for the Queen
&amp; old Albert, I put on my hat and walkt away.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ward," I solilerquized, as I walkt along, "Mrs. Ward, ef
you could see your husband now, just as he prowdly emerjis from the
presunts of the futur King of Ingland, you'd be sorry you called
him a Beest jest becaws he cum home tired 1 nite and wantid to go
to bed without takin orf his boots.&nbsp; You'd be sorry for tryin
to deprive yure husband of the priceliss Boon of liberty, Betsy
Jane!"</p>
<p>Jest then I met a long perseshun of men with gownds onto
'em.&nbsp; The leader was on horseback, &amp; ridin up to me he
sed, "Air you Orange?"</p>
<p>Sez I, "Which?"</p>
<p>"Air you a Orangeman?" he repeated, sternly.</p>
<p>"I used to peddle lemins," sed I, "but I never delt in
oranges.&nbsp; They are apt to spile on yure hands.&nbsp; What
particler Loonatic Asylum hev you &amp; yure frends escaped frum,
ef I may be so bold?"&nbsp; Just then a suddent thawt struck me
&amp; I sed, "Oh yure the fellers who air worryin the Prince so
&amp; givin the Juke of Noocastle cold sweats at nite, by yure
infernal catawalins, air you?&nbsp; Wall, take the advice of a
Amerykin sitterzen, take orf them gownds &amp; don't try to get up
a religious fite, which is 40 times wuss nor a prize fite, over
Albert Edard, who wants to receive you all on a ekal footin, not
keerin a tinker's cuss what meetin house you sleep in
Sundays.&nbsp; Go home &amp; mind yure bisness &amp; not make
noosenses of yourselves."&nbsp; With which observashuns I left
'em.</p>

blessins.&nbsp; I'm reguvinated.&nbsp; I've found the immortal
waters of yooth, so to speak, and am as limber and frisky as a

"is it not a dream?" &amp; suthin withinto me sez "it air;" but
when I look at them sweet little critters and hear 'em squawk, I
know it is a reality&mdash;2 realitys, I may say&mdash;and I feel
gay.</p>
<p>I returnd from the Summer Campane with my unparaleld show of wax
works and livin wild Beests of Pray in the early part of this
munch.&nbsp; The peple of Baldinsville met me cordully and I
immejitly commenst restin myself with my famerly,&nbsp; The other

room fire &amp; amuzin the krowd with sum of my adventurs, who
shood cum in bare heded &amp; terrible excited but Bill Stokes, who
sez, sez he, "Old Ward, there's grate doing up to your house."</p>
<p>Sez I, "William, how so?"</p>
<p>Sez he, "Bust my gizzud, but its grate doins," &amp; then larfed
as if heed kill hisself.</p>
<p>Sez I, risin and puttin on a austeer look, "William, I woodnut
be a fool if I had common cents."</p>
<p>But he kept on larfin till he was black in the face, when he
fell over on the bunk where the hostler sleeps, and in a still
small voice sed, "Twins!"&nbsp; I ashure you gents that the grass
didn't grow under my feet on my way home, &amp; I was followed by a
enthoosiastic throng of my feller sitterzens, who hurrard for Old
Ward at the top of their voises.&nbsp; I found the house chock full
of peple.&nbsp; Thare was Mrs. Square Baxter and her three grown-up
darters, lawyer Perkinses wife, Taberthy Ripley, young Eben
Parsuns, Deakun Simmuns folks, the Skoolmaster, Doctor Jordin,
etsetterry, etsetterry.&nbsp; Mis Ward was in the west room, which
jines the kitchin.&nbsp; Mis Square Baxter was mixin suthin in a
dipper before the kitchin fire, &amp; a small army of female wimin
were rushin wildly round the house with bottles of camfire, peaces
od flannil, &amp;c.&nbsp; I never seed such a hubbub in my natral
born dase.&nbsp; I cood not stay in the west room only a minit, so
strong was my feelings, so I rusht out and ceased my dubbel barrild
gun</p>
<p>"What on airth ales the man?" sez Taberthy Ripley.&nbsp; "Sakes
alive, what air you doin?" &amp; she grabd me by the tales.&nbsp;
"What's the matter with you?" she continnered.</p>

"twins!"</p>
<br />
<p>"I know it," sez she, coverin her pretty face with her
aprun.</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "that's what's the matter with me!"</p>
<p>"Wall, put down that air gun, you pesky old fool," sed she.</p>
<p>"No, morra," sez I, "this is a Nashunal day.&nbsp; The glory of
this here day isn't confined to Baldinsville by a darn site.&nbsp;
On yonder woodshed," sed I, drawin myself up to my full hite and
speakin in a show-actin voice, "will I fire a Nashunal saloot!"
sayin whitch I tared myself from her grasp and rush to to the top
of the shed whare I blazed away until Square Baxter's hired man and
my son Artemus Juneyer cum and took me down by mane force.</p>
<p>On returnin to the Kitchin I found quite a lot of people sealed
be4 the fire, a talkin the event over.&nbsp; They made room for me
&amp; I sot down.&nbsp; "Quite a eppisode," sed Docter Jordin,
litin his pipe with a red-hot coal.</p>
<p>"Yes," sed I, "2 eppisodes, waying abowt 18 pounds jintly."</p>
<p>"A perfeck coop de tat," sed the skoolmaster.</p>

of exchange papers in the corner, "to apply to the legislator for a

<p>Dear Betsy: I write you this from Boston, "the Modern Atkins,"

I'll giv you a kursoory view of this city.&nbsp; I'll klassify the

<p>COPP'S HILL.</p>
</center>
<p>The winder of my room commands a exileratin view of Copps' Hill,
where Cotton Mather, the father of the Reformers and sich, lies
berrid.&nbsp; There is men even now who worship Cotton, and there
is wimin who wear him next their harts.&nbsp; But I do not weep for
him.&nbsp; He's bin ded too lengthy.&nbsp; I ain't going to be
absurd, like old Mr. Skillins, in our naberhood, who is ninety-six
years of age, and gets drunk every 'lection day, and weeps Bitturly
because he haint got no Parents.&nbsp; He's a nice Orphan,
<i>he</i> is.</p>

<p>BUNKER HILL.</p>

<p>Bunker Hill is over yonder in Charleston.&nbsp; In 1776 a

Combination" played star parts.</p>
<center>
<p>MR. FANUEL.</p>
</center>
<p>Old Mr. Fanuel is ded, but his Hall is still into full
blarst.&nbsp; This is the Cradle in which the Goddess of Liberty
was rocked, my Dear.&nbsp; The Goddess hasn't bin very well durin'
the past few years, and the num'ris quack doctors she called in
didn't help her any; but the old gal's physicians now are men who
understand their bizness, Major-generally speakin', and I think the
day is near when she'll be able to take her three meals a day, and
sleep nights as comf'bly as in the old time.</p>

<p>THE COMMON.</p>
</center>
<p>It is here, as ushil; and the low cuss who called it a Wacant
Lot, and wanted to know why they didn't ornament it with sum
Bildins', is a onhappy Outcast in Naponsit.</p>
<center>
<p>THE LEGISLATUR.</p>
</center>
<p>The State House is filled with Statesmen, but sum of 'em wear
queer hats.&nbsp; They buy 'em, I take it, of hatters who carry on
hat stores down-stairs in Dock Square, and whose hats is either ten
years ahead of the prevailin' stile, or ten years behind
it&mdash;jest as a intellectooal person sees fit to think about
it.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of talkin' with sevril members of the
legislatur.&nbsp; I told 'em the Eye of 1000 ages was onto we
American peple of to-day.&nbsp; They seemed deeply impressed by the
remark, and wantid to know if I had seen the Grate Orgin?</p>
<center>
<p>HARVARD COLLEGE.</p>
</center>
<p>This celebrated institootion of learnin is pleasantly situated
in the Bar-room of Parker's in School street, and has poopils from
all over the country.</p>
<p>I had a letter yes'd'y, by the way, from our mootual son,
Artemus, Jr., who is at Bowdoin College in Maine.&nbsp; He writes
that he's a Bowdoin Arab. &amp; is it cum to this?&nbsp; Is this
Boy as I nurtered with a Parent's care into his childhood's
hour&mdash;is he goin' to be a Grate American humorist?&nbsp;
Alars!&nbsp; I fear it is too troo.&nbsp; Why didn't I bind him out
to the Patent Travellin Vegetable Pill Man, as was struck with his
appearance at our last County Fair, &amp; wanted him to go with him
and be a Pillist?&nbsp; Ar, these Boys&mdash;they little know how
the old folks worrit about 'em.&nbsp; But my father he never had no
occasion to worrit about me.&nbsp; You know, Betsy, that when I
fust commenced my career as a moral exhibitor with a six-legged cat
and a Bass drum, I was only a simple peasant child&mdash;skurce 15
Summers had flow'd over my yoothful hed.&nbsp; But I had sum mind
of my own.&nbsp; My father understood this.&nbsp; "Go," he
sed&mdash;"go, my son, and hog the public!" (he ment, "knock em,"
but the old man was allus a little given to slang).&nbsp; He put
his withered han' tremblinly onto my hed, and went sadly into the
house.&nbsp; I thought I saw tears tricklin down his venerable
chin, but it might hav been tobacker jooce.&nbsp; He chaw'd.</p>
<center>
<p>LITERATOOR.</p>
</center>
<p>The "Atlantic Monthly," Betsy, is a reg'lar visitor to our
westun home.&nbsp; I like it because it has got sense.&nbsp; It
don't print stories with piruts and honist young men into 'em,
makin' the piruts splendid fellers and the honist young men
dis'gree'ble idiots&mdash;so that our darters very nat'rally prefer
the piruts to the honist young idiots; but it gives us good square
American literatoor.&nbsp; The chaps that write for the "Atlantic,"
Betsy, understand their bizness.&nbsp; They can sling ink, they
can.&nbsp; I went in and saw 'em.&nbsp; I told 'em that theirs was
a high and holy mission.&nbsp; They seemed quite gratified, and
asked me if I had seen the Grate Orgin.</p>
<center>
<p>WHERE THE FUST BLUD WAS SPILT.</p>
</center>
<p>I went over to Lexington yes'd'y.&nbsp; My Boozum hove with
sollum emotions.&nbsp; "&amp; this," I sed to a man who was drivin'
a yoke of oxen, "this is where our revolutionary forefathers
asserted their independence and spilt their Blud.&nbsp; Classic
ground!"</p>
<p>"Wall," the man sed, "it's good for white beans and potatoes,
but was regards raisin' wheat, t'ain't worth a damn.&nbsp; But hav'
you seen the Grate Orgin?"</p>
<center>
<p>THE POOTY GIRL IN SPECTACLES.</p>
</center>
<p>I returned in the Hoss Cars, part way.&nbsp; A pooty girl in
spectacles sot near me, and was tellin' a young man how much he
reminded her of a man she used to know in Walthan.&nbsp; Pooty soon
the young man got out, and, smilin' in a seductive manner, I said
to the girl in spectacles, "Don't <i>I</i> remind you of somebody
you used to know?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she sed, "you do remind me of one man, but he was sent to
the penitentiary for stealin' a Bar'l of mackril&mdash;he died
there, so I conclood you ain't HIM."&nbsp; I didn't pursoo the
conversation.&nbsp; I only heard her silvery voice once more durin'
the remainder of the jerney.&nbsp; Turnin' to a respectable lookin'
female of advanced summers, she asked her if she had seen the Grate
Orgin.</p>
<p>We old chaps, my dear, air apt to forget that it is sum time
since we was infants, and et lite food.&nbsp; Nothin' of further
int'rist took place on the cars excep' a colored gentleman, a total
stranger to me, asked if I'd lend him my diamond Brestpin to wear
to a funeral in South Boston.&nbsp; I told him I wouldn't&mdash;not
a <i>purpuss</i>.</p>
<center>
<p>COMMON SKOOLS.</p>
</center>
<p>A excellent skool sistim is in vogy here.&nbsp; John Slurk, my
old pardner, has a little son who has only bin to skool two months,
and yet he exhibertid his father's performin' Bear in the show all
last summer.&nbsp; I hope they pay partic'lar 'tention to Spelin in
these Skools, because if a man can't Spel wel he's of no
'kount.</p>
<center>
<p>SUMMIN' UP.</p>
</center>
<p>I ment to have allooded to the Grate Orgin in this letter, but I
haven't seen it.&nbsp; Mr. Reveer, whose tavern I stop at, informed
me that it can be distinctly heard through a smoked glass in his
nativ town in New Hampshire, any clear day.&nbsp; But settin' the
Grate Orgin aside (and indeed, I don't think I heard it mentioned
all the time I was there), Boston is one of the grandest,
sure-footedest, clear headedest, comfortablest cities on the
globe.&nbsp;Onlike ev'ry other large city I was ever in, the most
of the hackmen don't seem to hav' bin speshully intended by natur
for the Burglery perfession, and it's about the only large city I
know of where you don't enjoy a brilliant opportunity of bein
swindled in sum way, from the Risin of the sun to the goin down
thereof.&nbsp; There4 I say, loud and continnered applaus' for
Boston!</p>

dignity of our house as to squirt dishwater on the Incum Tax
Collector.&nbsp; It is a disloyal act, and shows a prematoor
leanin' tords cussedness that alarms me.&nbsp; I send to Amelia
Ann, our oldest dawter, sum new music, viz. "I am Lonely sints My
Mother-in-law Died"; "Dear Mother, What tho' the Hand that Spanked
me in my Childhood's Hour is withered now?" &amp;c.&nbsp; These

<p><a name="abe" id="abe"></a>HOW OLD ABE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF HIS
NOMINATION.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>There are several reports afloat as to how "Honest Old Abe"
received the news of his nomination, none of which are correct. We
give the correct report.</p>
<p>The Official Committee arrived in Springfield at dewy eve, and
went to Honest Old Abe's house.&nbsp; Honest Old Abe was not
in.&nbsp; Mrs. Honest Old Abe said Honest Old Abe was out in the
woods splitting rails.&nbsp; So the Official Committee went out
into the woods, where sure enough they found Honest Old Abe
splitting rails with his two boys.&nbsp; It was a grand, a
magnificent spectacle.&nbsp; There stood Honest Old Abe in his
shirt-sleeves, a pair of leather home-made suspenders holding up a
pair of home-made pantaloons, the seat of which was neatly patched
with substantial cloth of a different color.&nbsp; "Mr Lincoln,
Sir, you've been nominated, Sir, for the highest office,
Sir&mdash;."&nbsp; "Oh, don't bother me," said Honest Old Abe; "I
took a <i>stent</i> this mornin' to split three million rails afore
night, and I don't want to be pestered with no stuff about no
Conventions till I get my stent done.&nbsp; I've only got two
hundred thousand rails to split before sundown.&nbsp; I kin do it
if you'll let me alone."&nbsp; And the great man went right on
splitting rails, paying no attention to the Committee
whatever.&nbsp; The Committee were lost in admiration for a few
moments, when they recovered, and asked one of Honest Old Abe's
boys whose boy he was?&nbsp; "I'm my parent's boy," shouted the
urchin, which burst of wit so convulsed the Committee that they
came very near "gin'in eout" completely.&nbsp; In a few moments
Honest Ole Abe finished his task, and received the news with
perfect self-possession.&nbsp; He then asked them up to the house,
where he received them cordially.&nbsp; He said he split three
million rails every day, although he was in very poor health.&nbsp;
Mr. Lincoln is a jovial man, and has a keen sense of the
ludicrous.&nbsp; During the evening he asked Mr. Evarts, of New
York, "why Chicago was like a hen crossing the street?"&nbsp; Mr.
Evarts gave it up.&nbsp; "Because," said Mr. Lincoln, "Old Grimes
is dead, that good old man!"&nbsp; This exceedingly humorous thing
created the most uproarious laughter.</p>

holler versiffrusly in the streets at nite and go home to Betsy
Jane smellen of coal ile and gin, in the mornin.&nbsp; I should go

should see to it that my nabers was thar.&nbsp; I should git
carriges to take the kripples, the infirm and the indignant
thar.&nbsp; I should be on guard agin frauds and sich.&nbsp; I
should be on the look out for the infamus lise of the enemy, got up
jest be4 elecshun for perlitical effeck.&nbsp; When all was over
and my candydate was elected, I should move heving &amp; erth so to
speak until I got orfice, which if I didn't git a orfice I should
turn round and abooze the Administration with all my mite and
maine.&nbsp; But I'm not in the bizniss.&nbsp; I'm in a far more
respectful bizniss nor what pollertics is.&nbsp; I wouldn't giv two
cents to be a Congresser.&nbsp; The wuss insult I ever received was
when sertin citizens of Baldinsville axed me to run fur the
Legislater.&nbsp; Sez I, "My frends, dostest think I'd stoop to
that there?"&nbsp; They turned as white as a sheet.&nbsp; I spoke
in my most orfullest tones &amp; they knowed I wasn't to be trifled
with.&nbsp; They slunked out of site to onct.</p>
<p>There4, havin no politics, I made bold to visit Old Abe at his
humstid in Springfield.&nbsp; I found the old feller in his parler,
surrounded by a perfeck swarm of orfice seekers.&nbsp; Knowin he
had been capting of a flat boat on the roarin Mississippy I thought
I'd address him in sailor lingo, so sez I, "Old Abe, ahoy!&nbsp;
Let out yer main-suls, reef hum the forecastle &amp; throw yer
jib-poop over-board!&nbsp; Shiver my timbers, my harty!"&nbsp;
[N.B. This is ginuine mariner langwidge.&nbsp; I know, becawz I've
seen sailor plays acted out by them New York theatre
fellers.]&nbsp; Old Abe lookt up quite cross &amp; sez, "Send in
yer petition by &amp; by.&nbsp; I can't possibly look at it
now.&nbsp; Indeed, I can't.&nbsp; It's onpossible, sir!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Linkin, who do you spect I air?" sed I.</p>
<p>"A orfice-seeker, to be sure," sed he.</p>
<p>"Wall, sir," sed I, "you's never more mistaken in your
life.&nbsp; You hain't gut a orfiss I'd take under no
circumstances.&nbsp; I'm A. Ward.&nbsp; Wax figgers is my
perfeshun.&nbsp; I'm the father of Twins, and they look like me
<i>both of them</i>.&nbsp; I cum to pay a friendly visit to the
President eleck of the United States.&nbsp; If so be you wants to
see me, say so, if not, say so &amp; I'm orf like a jug
handle."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ward, sit down.&nbsp; I am glad to see you, Sir."</p>
<p>"Repose in Abraham's Buzzum!" sed one of the orfice seekers, his
idee bein to git orf a goak at my expense.</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "ef all you fellers repose in that there Buzzum
thar'll be mity poor nussin for sum of you!" whereupon Old Abe
buttoned his weskit clear up and blusht like a maidin of sweet
16.&nbsp; Jest at this pint of the conversation another swarm of
orfice-seekers arrove &amp; cum pilin into the parler.&nbsp; Sum
wanted post orfices, sum wanted collectorships, sum wantid furrin
missions, and all wanted sumthin.&nbsp; I thought Old Abe would go
crazy.&nbsp; He hadn't more than had time to shake hands with 'em,
before another tremenjis crowd cum porein onto his premises.&nbsp;
His house and dooryard was now perfeckly overflowed with orfice
seekers, all clameruss for a immejit interview with with Old
Abe.&nbsp; One man from Ohio, who had about seven inches of corn
whisky into him, mistook me for Old Abe and addrest me as "The
Pra-hayrie Flower of the West!"&nbsp; Thinks I <i>you</i> want a
offiss putty bad.&nbsp; Another man with a gold-heded cane and a
red nose told Old Abe he was "a seckind Washington &amp; the Pride
of the Boundliss West."</p>
<p>Sez I, "Square, you wouldn't take a small post-offiss if you
could git it, would you?"</p>
<p>Sez he, "A patrit is abuv them things, sir!"</p>
<p>"There's a putty big crop of patrits this season, ain't there,
Squire?" sez I, when <i>another</i> crowd of offiss seekers pored
in.&nbsp; The house, dooryard, barng &amp; woodshed was now all
full, and when <i>another</i> crowd cum I told 'em not to go away
for want of room as the hog-pen was still empty.&nbsp; One patrit
from a small town in Michygan went up on top the house, got into
the chimney and slid into the parler where Old Abe was endeverin to
keep the hungry pack of orfice-seekers from chawin him up alive
without benefit of clergy.&nbsp; The minit he reached the fireplace
he jumpt up, brusht the soot out of his eyes, and yelled: "Don't
make eny pintment at the Spunkville postoffiss till you've read my
papers.&nbsp; All the respectful men in our town is signers to that
there dockyment!"</p>
<p>"Good God!" cried Old Abe, "they cum upon me from the skize down
the chimneys, and from the bowels of the yerth!"&nbsp; He hadn't
more'n got them words out of his delikit mouth before two fat
offiss-seekers from Winconsin, in endeverin to crawl atween his
legs for the purpuss of applyin for the tollgateship at Milwawky,
upsot the President eleck, &amp; he would hev gone sprawlin into
the fireplace if I hadn't caught him in these arms.&nbsp; But I
hadn't more'n stood him up strate before another man cum crashing
down the chimney, his head strikin me viliently again the inards
and prostratin my voluptoous form onto the floor.&nbsp; "Mr.
Linkin," shoutid the infatooated being, "my papers is signed by
every clergyman in our town, and likewise the skoolmaster!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "You egrejis ass," gittin up &amp; brushin the dust from
my eyes, "I'll sign your papers with this bunch of bones, if you
don't be a little more keerful how you make my bread basket a depot
in the futur.&nbsp; How do you like that air perfumery?" sez I,
shuving my fist under his nose.&nbsp; "Them's the kind of papers
I'll give you!&nbsp; Them's the papers <i>you</i> want!"</p>
<p>"But I workt hard for the ticket; I toiled night and day! The
patrit should be rewarded!"</p>
<p>"Virtoo," sed I, holdin' the infatooated man by the coat-collar,
"virtoo, sir, is its own reward.&nbsp; Look at me!"&nbsp; He did
look at me, and qualed be4 my gase.&nbsp; "The fact is," I
continued, lookin' round on the hungry crowd, "there is scacely a
offiss for every ile lamp carrid round durin' this campane.&nbsp; I
wish thare was.&nbsp; I wish thare was furrin missions to be filled
on varis lonely Islands where eppydemics rage incessantly, and if I
was in Old Abe's place I'd send every mother's son of you to
them.&nbsp; What air you here for?" I continnered, warmin up
considerable, "can't you giv Abe a minit's peace?&nbsp; Don't you
see he's worrid most to death?&nbsp; Go home, you miserable men, go
home &amp; till the sile!&nbsp; Go to peddlin tinware&mdash;go to

don't come round here drivin Old Abe crazy by your outrajis
cuttings up!&nbsp; Go home.&nbsp; Stand not upon the order of your
goin,' but go to onct!&nbsp; Ef in five minits from this time," sez
I, pullin' out my new sixteen dollar huntin cased watch and
brandishin' it before their eyes, "Ef in five minits from this time
a single sole of you remains on these here premises, I'll go out to
my cage near by, and let my Boy Constructor loose! &amp; ef he gits
amung you, you'll think old Solferino has cum again and no
mistake!"&nbsp; You ought to hev seen them scamper, Mr. Fair.&nbsp;
They run ort as tho Satun hisself was arter them with a red hot ten
pronged pitchfork.&nbsp; In five minits the premises was clear.</p>
<p>"How kin I ever repay you, Mr. Ward, for your kindness?" sed Old
Abe, advancin and shakin me warmly by the hand.&nbsp; "How kin I
ever repay you, sir?"</p>
<p>"By givin the whole country a good, sound administration.&nbsp;
By poerin' ile upon the troubled waturs, North and South.&nbsp; By
pursooin' a patriotic, firm, and just course, and then if any State
wants to secede, let 'em Sesesh!"</p>
<p>"How 'bout my Cabinit, Mister Ward?" sed Abe.</p>
<p>"Fill it up with Showmen, sir!&nbsp; Showmen, is devoid of
politics.&nbsp; They hain't got any principles.&nbsp; They know how
to cater for the public.&nbsp; They know what the public wants,
North &amp; South.&nbsp; Showmen, sir, is honest men.&nbsp; Ef you
doubt their literary ability, look at their posters, and see small
bills!&nbsp; Ef you want a Cabinit as is a Cabinit fill it up with
showmen, but don't call on me.&nbsp; The moral wax figger perfeshun
musn't be permitted to go down while there's a drop of blood in
these vains!&nbsp; A. Linkin, I wish you well!&nbsp; Ef Powers or
Walcutt wus to pick out a model for a beautiful man, I scarcely
think they'd sculp you; but ef you do the fair thing by your
country you'll make as putty a angel as any of us!&nbsp; A. Linkin,
use the talents which Nature has put into you judishusly and
firmly, and all will be well!&nbsp; A. Linkin, adoo!"</p>
<p>He shook me cordyully by the hand&mdash;we exchanged picters, so
we could gaze upon each other's liniments, when far away from one
another&mdash;he at the hellum of the ship of State, and I at the
hellum of the show bizniss admittance only 15 cents.</p>

there to see the Prints Napoleon, and not to see the place, which I
will here take occasion to obsarve is about as uninterestin a
locality as there is this side of J. Davis's future home, if he
ever does die, and where I reckon they'll make it so warm for him
that he will si for his summer close.&nbsp; It is easy enough to
see why a man goes to the poor house or the penitentiary.&nbsp;
It's becawz he can't help it.&nbsp; But why he should woluntarily
go and live in Washinton, is intirely beyond my comprehension, and
I can't say no fairer nor that.</p>
<p>I put up to a leadin hotel.&nbsp; I saw the landlord and sed,
"How d'ye do, Square?"</p>
<p>"Fifty cents, sir," was his reply.</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>"Half-a-dollar.&nbsp; We charge twenty-five cents for
<i>lookin</i> at the landlord and fifty cents for speakin to
him.&nbsp; If you want supper, a boy will show you to the
dinin-room for twenty-five cents.&nbsp; Your room bein in the tenth
story, it will cost you a dollar to be shown up there."</p>
<p>"How much do you ax for a man breathin in this equinomikal
tarvun?" sed I.</p>
<p>"Ten cents a Breth," was his reply.</p>
<p>Washinton hotels is very reasonable in their charges.&nbsp;
[N.B. This is Sarkassum.]</p>
<p>I sent up my keerd to the Prints, and was immejitly ushered
before him.&nbsp; He received me kindly, and axed me to sit
down.</p>
<p>"I hav cum to pay my respecks to you, Mister Napoleon, hopin I
see you hale and harty."</p>
<p>"I am quite well," he sed.&nbsp; "Air you well, sir?"</p>
<p>"Sound as a cuss!" I answerd.</p>
<p>He seemed to be pleased with my ways, and we entered into
conversation to onct.</p>
<p>"How's Lewis?" I axed, and he sed the Emperor was well.&nbsp;
Eugeny was likewise well, he sed.&nbsp; Then I axed him was Lewis a
good provider? did he cum home arly nites? did he perfoom her
bedroom at a onseasonable hour with gin and tanzy?&nbsp; Did he go
to "the Lodge" on nites when there wasn't any Lodge? did he often
hav to go down town to meet a friend? did he hav a extensiv
acquaintance among poor young widders whose husbands was in
Californy? to all of which questions the Prints perlitely replide,
givin me to understand that the Emperor was behavin well.</p>
<p>"I ax these question, my royal duke and most noble hiness and
imperials, becaws I'm anxious to know how he stands as a man.&nbsp;
I know he's smart.&nbsp; He is cunnin, he is long-heded, he is
deep&mdash;he is grate.&nbsp; But onless he is <i>good</i> he'll
come down with a crash one of these days and the Bonyparts will be
Bustid up agin.&nbsp; Bet yer life!"</p>
<p>"Air you a preacher, sir?" he inquired slitely sarkasticul.</p>
<p>"No, sir.&nbsp; But I bleeve in morality.&nbsp; I likewise
bleeve in Meetin Houses.&nbsp; Show me a place where there isn't
any Meetin Houses and where preachers is never seen, and I'll show
you a place where old hats air stuffed into broken winders, where
the children air dirty and ragged, where gates have no hinges,
where the wimin are slipshod, and where maps of the devil's "wild
land" air painted upon men's shirt bosums with tobacco-jooce!&nbsp;
That's what I'll show you.&nbsp; Let us consider what the preachers
do for us before we aboose 'em."</p>
<p>He sed he didn't mean to aboose the clergy.&nbsp; Not at all,
and he was happy to see that I was interested in the Bonypart
family.</p>
<p>"It's a grate family," sed I.&nbsp; "But they scooped the old
man in."</p>
<p>"How, Sir?"</p>
<p>"Napoleon the Grand.&nbsp; The Britishers scooped him at
Waterloo.&nbsp; He wanted to do too much, and he did it!&nbsp; They
scooped him in at Waterloo, and he subsekently died at St.
Heleny!&nbsp; There's where the gratest military man this world
ever projuced pegged out.&nbsp; It was rather hard to consine such
a man as him to St. Heleny, to spend his larst days in catchin
mackeril, and walkin up and down the dreary beach in a military
cloak drawn titely round him, (see picter-books), but so it
was.&nbsp; 'Hed of the Army!'&nbsp; Them was his larst words.&nbsp;
So he had bin. He was grate!&nbsp; Don't I wish we had a pair of
his old boots to command sum of our Brigades!"</p>
<p>This pleased Jerome, and he took me warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>"Alexander the Grate was punkins," I continnered, "but Napoleon
was punkinser!&nbsp; Alic wept becaws there was no more worlds to
scoop, and then took to drinkin.&nbsp; He drowndid his sorrers in
the flowin bole, and the flowin bole was too much for him.&nbsp; It
ginerally is.&nbsp; He undertook to give a snake exhibition in his
boots, but it killed him.&nbsp; That was a bad joke on Alic!"</p>
<p>"Since you air so solicitous about France and the Emperor, may I
ask you how your own country is getting along?" sed Jerome, in a
pleasant voice.</p>
<p>"It's mixed," I sed.&nbsp; But I think we shall cum out all
right."</p>
<p>"Columbus, when he diskivered this magnificent continent, could
hav had no idee of the grandeur it would one day assoom," sed the
Prints.</p>
<p>"It cost Columbus twenty thousand dollars to fit out his
explorin expedition," sed I.&nbsp; "If he had bin a sensible man
he'd hav put the money in a hoss railroad or a gas company, and
left this magnificent continent to intelligent savages, who when
they got hold of a good thing knew enuff to keep it, and who
wouldn't hav seceded, nor rebelled, nor knockt Liberty in the hed
with a slungshot.&nbsp; Columbus wasn't much of a feller, after
all.&nbsp; It would hav bin money in my pocket if he'd staid at
home.&nbsp; Chris. ment well, but he put his foot in it when he
saled for America."</p>
<p>We talked sum more about matters and things, and at larst I riz
to go.&nbsp; "I will now say good-bye to you, noble sir, and good
luck to you.&nbsp; Likewise the same to Clotildy.&nbsp; Also to the
gorgeous persons which compose your soot.&nbsp; If the Emperor's
boy don't like livin at the Tooleries, when he gits older, and
would like to imbark in the show bizness, let him come with me and
I'll make a man of him.&nbsp; You find us sumwhat mixed, as I
before obsarved, but come again next year and you'll find us
clearer nor ever.&nbsp; The American Eagle has lived too
sumptuously of late his stummic becum foul, and he's takin a slite
emetic.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; We're getting ready to strike a big
blow and a sure one.&nbsp; When we do strike, the fur will fly and
secession will be in the hands of the undertaker, sheeted for so
deep a grave that nothin short of Gabriel's trombone will ever
awaken it!&nbsp; Mind what I say.&nbsp; You've heard the
showman!"</p>
<p>Then advisin him to keep away from the Peter Funk sections of
the East, and the proprietors of corner-lots in the West, I bid him
farewell, and went away.</p>
<p>There was a levee at Senator What's-his-name's, and I thought
I'd jine in the festivities for a spell.&nbsp; Who should I see but
she that was Sarah Watkins, now the wife of our Congresser, trippin
in the dance, dressed up to kill in her store close.&nbsp; Sarah's
father use to keep a little grosery store in our town and she used
to clerk it for him in busy times.&nbsp; I was rushin up to shake
hands with her when she turned on her heel, and tossin her hed in a
contemptooious manner, walked away from me very rapid.&nbsp;
"Hallo, Sal," I hollered, "can't you measure me a quart of them
best melasses?&nbsp; I may want a codfish, also!"&nbsp; I guess
this reminded her of the little red store, and "the days of her
happy childhood."</p>
<p>But I fell in love with a nice little gal after that, who was
much sweeter then Sally's father's melasses, and I axed her if we
shouldn't glide in the messy dance.&nbsp; She sed we should, and we
Glode.</p>
<p>I intended to make this letter very seris, but a few goaks may
have accidentally crept in.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; Besides, I
think it improves a komick paper to publish a goak once in a
while.</p>

</center>
<br />
<p>The Barclay County Agricultural Society having seriously invited
the author of this volume to address them on the occasion of their
next annual Fair, he wrote the President of that Society as
follows:</p>
<p align="right">New York. June 12, 1865,</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 5th inst., in which you invite me to deliver an address before
your excellent agricultural society.</p>
<p>I feel flattered, and think I will come.</p>
<p>Perhaps, meanwhile, a brief history of my experience as an
agriculturist will be acceptable; and as that history no doubt
contains suggestions of value to the entire agricultural community,
I have concluded to write to you through the Press.</p>
<p>I have been an honest old farmer for some four years.</p>
<p>My farm is in the interior of Maine.&nbsp; Unfortunately my
lands are eleven miles from the railroad.&nbsp; Eleven miles is
quite a distance to haul immense quantities of wheat, corn, rye,
and oats; but as I hav'n't any to haul, I do not, after all, suffer
much on that account.</p>
<p>My farm is more especially a grass farm.</p>
<p>My neighbors told me so at first, and as an evidence that they
were sincere in that opinion, they turned their cows on to it the
moment I went off "lecturing."</p>
<p>These cows are now quite fat.&nbsp; I take pride in these cows,
in fact, and am glad I own a grass farm.</p>
<p>Two years ago I tried sheep-raising.</p>
<p>I bought fifty lambs, and turned them loose on my broad and
beautiful acres.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/11.gif" alt=
"Browne strolling in his dressing gown" />It was pleasant on bright
mornings to stroll leisurely out on to the farm in my
dressing-gown, with a cigar in my mouth, and watch those innocent
little lambs as they danced gayly o'er the hillside.&nbsp; Watching
their saucy capers reminded me of caper sauce, and it occurred to
me I should have some very fine eating when they grew up to be
"muttons."</p>
<br />
<p>My gentle shepherd, Mr. Eli Perkins, said, "We must have some
shepherd dogs."</p>
<p>I had no very precise idea as to what shepherd dogs were, but I
assumed a rather profound look, and said:</p>
<p>"We must, Eli.&nbsp; I spoke to you about this some time
ago!"</p>
<p>I wrote to my old friend, Mr. Dexter H. Follett, of Boston, for
two shepherd dogs.&nbsp; Mr. F. is not an honest old farmer
himself, but I thought he knew about shepherd dogs.&nbsp; He kindly
forsook far more important business to accommodate, and the dogs
came forthwith.&nbsp; They were splendid creatures snuff-colored,
hazel-eyed, long-tailed, and shapely-jawed.</p>
<p>We led them proudly to the fields.</p>
<p>"Turn them in, Eli," I said.</p>
<p>Eli turned them in.</p>
<p>They went in at once, and killed twenty of my best lambs in
about four minutes and a half.</p>
<p>My friend had made a trifling mistake in the breed of these
dogs.</p>
<p>These dogs were not partial to sheep.</p>
<p>Eli Perkins was astonished, and observed:</p>
<p>"Waal!&nbsp; DID you ever?"</p>
<p>I certainly never had.</p>
<p>There were pools of blood on the greensward, and fragments of
wool and raw lamb chops lay round in confused heaps.</p>
<p>The dogs would have been sent to Boston that night, had they not
suddenly died that afternoon of a throat-distemper.&nbsp; It wasn't
a swelling of the throat.&nbsp; It wasn't diptheria.&nbsp; It was a
violent opening of the throat, extending from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Thus closed their life-stories.&nbsp; Thus ended their
interesting tails.</p>
<p>I failed as a raiser of lambs.&nbsp; As a sheepist, I was not a
success.</p>
<p>Last summer Mr. Perkins, said, "I think we'd better cut some
grass this season, sir."</p>
<p>We cut some grass.</p>
<p>To me the new-mown hay is very sweet and nice.&nbsp; The
brilliant George Arnold sings about it, in beautiful verse, down in
Jersey every summer; so does the brilliant Aldrich, at Portsmouth,
N.H.&nbsp; And yet I doubt if either of these men knows the price
of a ton of hay to-day.&nbsp; But new-mown hay is a really fine
thing.&nbsp; It is good for man and beast.</p>
<p>We hired four honest farmers to assist us, and I led them gayly
to the meadows.</p>
<p>I was going to mow, myself.</p>
<p>I saw the sturdy peasants go round once ere I dipped my flashing
scythe into the tall green grass.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" said E. Perkins.</p>
<p>"I am here!"</p>
<p>"Then follow us."</p>
<p>I followed them.</p>
<p>Followed them rather too closely, evidently, for a white-haired
old man, who immediately followed Mr. Perkins, called upon us to
halt.&nbsp; Then in a low firm voice he said to his son, who was
just ahead of me, "John, change places with me.&nbsp; I hain't got
long to live, anyhow.&nbsp; Yonder berryin' ground will soon have
these old bones, and it's no matter whether I'm carried there with
one leg off and ter'ble gashes in the other or not!&nbsp; But you,
John <i>you</i> are young."</p>
<p>The old man changed places with his son.&nbsp; A smile of calm
resignation lit up his wrinkled face, as he sed, "Now, sir, I am
ready!"</p>
<p>"What mean you, old man!" I sed.</p>
<p>"I mean that if you continner to bran'ish that blade as you have
been bran'ishin' it, you'll slash hout of some of us before we're a
hour older!"</p>
<p>There was some reason mingled with this white-haired old
peasant's profanity.&nbsp; It was true that I had twice escaped
mowing off his son's legs, and his father was perhaps naturally
alarmed.</p>
<p>I went and sat down under a tree.&nbsp; "I never know'd a
literary man in my life," I overheard the old man say, "that know'd
anything."</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins was not as valuable to me this season as I had
fancied he might be.&nbsp; Every afternoon he disappeared from the
field regularly, and remained about some two hours.&nbsp; He sed it
was headache.&nbsp; He inherited it from his mother.&nbsp; His
mother was often taken in that way, and suffered a great deal.</p>
<p>At the end of the two hours Mr. Perkins would reappear with his
head neatly done up in a large wet rag, and say he "felt
better."</p>
<p>One afternoon it so happened that I soon followed the invalid to
the house, and as I neared the porch I heard a female voice
energetically observe, "You stop!"&nbsp; It was the voice of the
hired girl, and she added, "I'll holler for Mr. Brown!"</p>
<p>"Oh no, Nancy," I heard the invalid E. Perkins soothingly say,
"Mr. Brown knows I love you.&nbsp; Mr. Brown approves of it!"</p>
<p>This was pleasant for Mr. Brown!</p>
<p>I peered cautiously through the kitchen-blinds, and, however
unnatural it may appear, the lips of Eli Perkins and my hired girl
were very near together.&nbsp; She sed, "You shan't do so," and he
<i>do-soed</i>.&nbsp; She also said she would get right up and go
away, and as an evidence that she was thoroughly in earnest about
it, she remained where she was.</p>
<p>They are married now, and Mr. Perkins is troubled no more with
the headache.</p>
<p>This year we are planting corn.&nbsp; Mr. Perkins writes me that
"on accounts of no skare krows bein put up krows cum and digged
fust crop up but soon got nother in.&nbsp; Old Bisbee who was frade
youd cut his sons leggs off Ses you bet go an stan up in feeld

</center>
<br />
<p>There are in this city several Italian gentlemen engaged in the
bust business.&nbsp; They have their peculiarities and
eccentricities.&nbsp; They are swarthy-faced, wear slouched caps
and drab pea-jackets, and smoke bad cigars.&nbsp; They make busts
of Webster, Clay, Bonaparte, Douglas, and other great men, living
and dead.&nbsp; The Italian buster comes upon you solemnly and
cautiously.&nbsp; "Buy Napoleon?" he will say, and you may probably
answer "not a buy."&nbsp; "How much giv-ee?" he asks, and perhaps
you will ask him how much he wants.&nbsp; "Nine dollar," he will
answer always.&nbsp; We are sure of it.&nbsp; We have observed this
peculiarity in the busters frequently.&nbsp; No matter how large or
small the bust may be, the first price is invariably "nine
dollar."&nbsp; If you decline paying this price, as you undoubtedly
will if you are right in your head, he again asks, "how much
giv-ee?"&nbsp; By way of a joke you say "a dollar," when the buster
retreats indignantly to the door, saying in a low, wild voice, "O
dam!"&nbsp; With his hand upon the door-latch, he turns and once
more asks, "how much giv-ee?"&nbsp; You repeat the previous offer,
when he mutters, "O ha!" then coming pleasantly towards you, he
speaks thus: "Say! how much giv-ee?"&nbsp; Again you say a dollar,
and he cries, "take 'um take 'um!" thus falling eight dollars on
his original price.</p>
<p>Very eccentric is the Italian buster, and sometimes he calls his
busts by wrong names.&nbsp; We bought Webster (he called him
Web-STAR) of him the other day, and were astonished when he called
upon us the next day with another bust of Webster, exactly like the
one we had purchased of him, and asked us if we didn't want to buy
"Cole, the wife-pizener!"&nbsp; We endeavored to rebuke the
depraved buster, but our utterance was choked, and we could only
gaze upon him in speechless astonishment and indignation.</p>

<p><a name="case" id="case"></a>A HARD CASE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>We have heard of some very hard cases since we have enlivened
this world with our brilliant presence.&nbsp; We once saw an
able-bodied man chase a party of little school-children and rob
them of their dinners.&nbsp; The man who stole the coppers from his
deceased grandmother's eyes lived in our neighborhood, and we have
read about the man who went to church for the sole purpose of
stealing the testaments and hymn-books.&nbsp; But the hardest case
we ever heard of lived in Arkansas.&nbsp; He was only fourteen
years old.&nbsp; One night he deliberately murdered his father and
mother in cold blood, with a meat-axe.&nbsp; He was tried and found
guilty.&nbsp; The Judge drew on his black cap, and in a voice
choked with emotion asked the young prisoner if he had anything to
say before the sentence of the Court was passed on him.&nbsp; The
court-room was densely crowded and there was not a dry eye in the
vast assembly.&nbsp; The youth of the prisoner, his beauty and
innocent looks, the mild, lamblike manner in which he had conducted
himself during the trial all, all had thoroughly enlisted the
sympathy of the spectators, the ladies in particular.&nbsp; And
even the Jury, who had found it to be their stern duty to declare
him guilty of the appalling crime even the Jury now wept aloud at
this awful moment.</p>
<p>"Have you anything to say?" repeated the deeply moved Judge.</p>
<p>"Why, no," replied the prisoner, "I think I haven't, though I
hope yer Honor will show some consideration <i>for the feelings of
a poor orphan</i>!"</p>
<p>The Judge sentenced the perfect young wretch without delay.</p>

<p><a name="affairs" id="affairs"></a>AFFAIRS AROUND THE VILLAGE
GREEN.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>It isn't every one who has a village green to write about.&nbsp;
I have one, although I have not seen much of it for some years
past.&nbsp; I am back again, now.&nbsp; In the language of the duke
who went around with a motto about him, "I am here!" and I fancy I
am about as happy a peasant of the vale as ever garnished a
melodrama, although I have not as yet danced on my village green,
as the melodramatic peasant usually does on his.&nbsp; It was the
case when Rosina Meadows left home.</p>
<p>The time rolls by serenely now so serenely that I don't care
what time it is, which is fortunate, because my watch is at present
in the hands of those "men of New York who are called
rioters."&nbsp; We met by chance, the usual way certainly not by
appointment and I brought the interview to a close with all
possible despatch.&nbsp; Assuring them that I wasn't Mr. Greeley,
particularly, and that he had never boarded in the private family
where I enjoy the comforts of a home, I tendered them my watch, and
begged they would distribute it judiciously among the laboring
classes, as I had seen the rioters styled in certain public
prints.</p>
<p>Why should I loiter feverishly in Broadway, stabbing the hissing
hot air with the splendid gold-headed cane that was presented to me
by the citizens of Waukegan, Illinois, as a slight testimonial of
their esteem?&nbsp; Why broil in my rooms?&nbsp; You said to me,
Mrs. Gloverson, when I took possession of these rooms, that no
matter how warm it might be, a breeze had a way of blowing into
them, and that they were, withal, quite countryfied; but I am bound
to say, Mrs. Gloverson, that there was nothing about them that ever
reminded me, in the remotest degree, of daisies or new-mown
hay.&nbsp; Thus, with sarcasm, do I smash the deceptive
Gloverson.</p>
<p>Why stay in New York when I had a village green?&nbsp; I gave it
up, the same as I would an intricate conundrum and, in short, I am
here.</p>
<p>Do I miss the glare and crash of the imperial
thoroughfare?&nbsp; The milkman, the fiery, untamed omnibus horses,
the soda fountains, Central Park, and those things?&nbsp; Yes I do;
and I can go on missing 'em for quite a spell, and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The village from which I write to you is small.&nbsp; It does
not contain over forty houses, all told; but they are milk-white,
with the greenest of blinds, and for the most part are shaded with
beautiful elms and willows.&nbsp; To the right of us is a mountain
to the left a lake.&nbsp; The village nestles between.&nbsp; Of
course it does, I never read a novel in my life in which the
villages didn't nestle.&nbsp; Villages invariably nestle.&nbsp; It
is a kind of way they have.</p>
<p>We are away from the cars.&nbsp; The iron-horse, as my little
sister aptly remarks in her composition On Nature, is never heard
to shriek in our midst; and on the whole I am glad of it.</p>
<p>The villagers are kindly people.&nbsp; They are rather
incoherent on the subject of the war, but not more so, perhaps,
then are people elsewhere.&nbsp; One citizen, who used to sustain a
good character, subscribed for the Weekly New York Herald a few
months since, and went to studying the military maps in that
well-known journal for the fireside.&nbsp; I need not inform you
that his intellect now totters, and he has mortgaged his
farm.&nbsp; In a literary point of view we are rather
bloodthirsty.&nbsp; A pamphlet edition of the life of a cheerful
being, who slaughtered his wife and child, and then finished
himself, is having an extensive sale just now.</p>
<p>We know little of Honore de Balzac, and perhaps care less for
Victor Hugo.&nbsp; M. Claes's grand search for the Absolute doesn't
thrill us in the least; and Jean Valjean, gloomily picking his way
through the sewers of Paris, with the spooney young man of the name
of Marius upon his back, awakens no interest in our breasts.&nbsp;
I say Jean Valjean picked his way gloomily, and I repeat it.&nbsp;
No man, under these circumstances, could have skipped gayly.&nbsp;
But this literary business, as the gentleman who married his
colored chambermaid aptly observed, "is simply a matter of
taste."</p>
<p>The store I must not forget the store.&nbsp; It is an object of
great interest to me.&nbsp; I usually encounter there, on sunny
afternoons, an old Revolutionary soldier.&nbsp; You may possibly
have read about "Another Revolutionary Soldier gone," but this is
one who hasn't gone, and, moreover, one who doesn't manifest the
slightest intention of going.&nbsp; He distinctly remembers
Washington, of course; they all do; but what I wish to call special
attention to, is the fact that this Revolutionary soldier is one
hundred years old, that his eyes are so good that he can read fine
print without spectacles&mdash;he never used them, by the way and
his mind is perfectly clear.&nbsp; He is a little shaky in one of
his legs, but otherwise he is as active as most men of forty-five,
and his general health is excellent.&nbsp; He uses no tobacco, but
for the last twenty years he has drunk one glass of liquor every
day no more, no less.&nbsp; He says he must have his tod.&nbsp; I
had begun to have lurking suspicions about this Revolutionary
soldier business, but here is an original Jacobs. But because a man
can drink a glass of liquor a day, and live to be a hundred years
old, my young readers must not infer that by drinking two glasses
of liquor a day a man can live to be two hundred.&nbsp; "Which, I
meanter say, it doesn't foller," as Joseph Gargery might
observe.</p>
<p>This store, in which may constantly be found calico and nails,
and fish, and tobacco in kegs, and snuff in bladders, is a
venerable establishment.&nbsp; As long ago as 1814 it was an
institution.&nbsp; The county troops, on their way to the defence
of Portland, then menaced by British ships-of-war, were drawn up in
front of this very store, and treated at the town's expense.&nbsp;
Citizens will tell you how the clergyman refused to pray for the
troops, because he considered the war an unholy one; and how a
somewhat eccentric person, of dissolute habits, volunteered his
services, stating that he once had an uncle who was a deacon, and
he thought he could make a tolerable prayer, although it was rather
out of his line; and how he prayed so long and absurdly that the
Colonel ordered him under arrest, but that even while soldiers
stood over him with gleaming bayonets, the reckless being sang a
preposterous song about his grandmother's spotted calf, with its
Ri-fol-lol-tiddery-i-do; after which he howled dismally.</p>
<p>And speaking of the store, reminds me of a little story.&nbsp;
The author of "several successful comedies" has been among us, and
the store was anxious to know who the stranger was.&nbsp; And
therefore the store asked him.</p>
<p>"What do you follow, sir?" respectfully inquired the
tradesman.</p>
<p>"I occasionally write for the stage, sir."</p>
<p>"Oh!" returned the tradesman, in a confused manner.</p>
<p>"He means," said an honest villager, with a desire to help the
puzzled tradesman out, "he means that he writes the handbills for
the stage drivers!"</p>
<p>I believe that story is new, although perhaps it is not of an
uproariously mirthful character; but one hears stories at the store
that are old enough, goodness knows stories which, no doubt,
diverted Methuselah in the sunny days of his giddy and thoughtless
boyhood.</p>
<p>There is an exciting scene at the store occasionally.&nbsp;
Yesterday an athletic peasant, in a state of beer, smashed in a
counter and emptied two tubs of butter on the floor.&nbsp; His
father a white-haired old man, who was a little boy when the
Revolutionary war closed, but who doesn't remember Washington
<i>much</i>, came round in the evening and settled for the
damages.&nbsp; "My son," he said, "has considerable
originality."&nbsp; I will mention that this same son once told me
that he could lick me with one arm tied behind him, and I was so
thoroughly satisfied he could, that I told him he needn't mind
going for a rope.</p>
<p>Sometimes I go a-visiting to a farmhouse, on which occasions the
parlor is opened.&nbsp; The windows have been close-shut ever since
the last visitor was there, and there is a dingy smell that I
struggle as calmly as possible with, until I am led to the banquet
of steaming hot biscuit and custard pie.&nbsp; If they would only
let me sit in the dear old-fashioned kitchen, or on the door-stone
if they knew how dismally the new black furniture looked but, never
mind, I am not a reformer.&nbsp; No, I should rather think not.</p>
<p>Gloomy enough, this living on a farm, you perhaps say, in which
case you are wrong.&nbsp; I can't exactly say that I pant to be an
agriculturist, but I do know that in the main it is an independent,
calmly happy sort of life.&nbsp; I can see how the prosperous
farmer can go joyously a-field with the rise of the sun, and how
his heart may swell with pride over bounteous harvests and sleek
oxen.&nbsp; And it must be rather jolly for him on winter evenings
to sit before the bright kitchen fire and watch his rosy boys and
girls as they study out the charades in the weekly paper, and
gradually find out why my first is something that grows in a
garden, and my second is a fish.</p>
<p>On the green hillside over yonder there is a quivering of snowy
drapery, and bright hair is flashing in the morning sunlight.&nbsp;
It is recess, and the Seminary girls are running in the tall
grass.</p>
<p>A goodly seminary to look at outside, certainly, although I am
pained to learn, as I do on unprejudiced authority, that Mrs.
Higgins, the Principal, is a tyrant, who seeks to crush the girls
and trample upon them; but my sorrow is somewhat assuaged by
learning that Skimmerhorn, the pianist, is perfectly splendid.</p>
<p>Looking at these girls reminds me that I, too, was once young
and where are the friends of my youth?&nbsp; I have found one of
'em, certainly.&nbsp; I saw him ride in the circus the other day on
a bareback horse, and even now his name stares at me from yonder
board-fence, in green, and blue, and red, and yellow letters.&nbsp;
Dashington, the youth with whom I used to read the able orations of
Cicero, and who, as a declaimer on exhibition days, used to wipe
the rest of us boys pretty handsomely out&mdash;well, Dashington is
identified with the halibut and cod interest&mdash;drives a fish
cart, in fact, from a certain town on the coast, back into the
interior.&nbsp; Hurbertson, the utterly stupid boy the lunkhead,
who never had his lesson he's about the ablest lawyer a sister
State can boast.&nbsp; Mills is a newspaper man, and is just now
editing a Major-General down South.</p>
<p>Singlinson, the sweet-voiced boy, whose face was always washed
and who was real good, and who was never rude&mdash;<i>he</i> is in
the penitentiary for putting his uncle's autograph to a financial
document.&nbsp; Hawkins, the clergyman's son, is an actor, and
Williamson, the good little boy who divided his bread and butter
with the beggarman, is a failing merchant, and makes money by
it.&nbsp; Tom Slink, who used to smoke short-sixes and get
acquainted with the little circus boys, is popularly supposed to be
the proprietor of a cheap gaming establishment in Boston, where the
beautiful but uncertain prop is nightly tossed.&nbsp; Be sure, the
Army is represented by many of the friends of my youth, the most of
whom have given a good account of themselves.&nbsp; But Chalmerson
hasn't done much.&nbsp; No, Chalmerson is rather of a
failure.&nbsp; He plays on the guitar and sings love songs.&nbsp;
Not that he is a bad man.&nbsp; A kinder-hearted creature never
lived, and they say he hasn't yet got over crying for his little
curly haired sister who died ever so long ago.&nbsp; But he knows
nothing about business, politics, the world, and those
things.&nbsp; He is dull at trade indeed, it is a common remark
that "everybody cheats Chalmerson."&nbsp; He came to the party the
other evening, and brought his guitar.&nbsp; They wouldn't have him
for a tenor in the opera, certainly, for he is shaky in his upper
notes; but if his simple melodies didn't gush straight from the
heart, why were my trained eyes wet?&nbsp; And although some of the
girls giggled, and some of the men seemed to pity him I could not
help fancying that poor Chalmerson was nearer heaven than any of us
all!</p>

<p>You hav perhaps wondered wharebouts I was for these many dase
gone and past.</p>
<p>Perchans you sposed I'd gone to the Tomb of the Cappylets, tho I
don't know what those is.</p>
<p>It's a popler noospaper frase.</p>
<p>Listen to my tail, and be silent that ye may here I've been
among the Seseshers, a earnin my daily peck by my legitimit
perfeshun, and havn't had no time to weeld my facile quill for "the
Grate Komick paper," if you'll allow me to kote from your troothful
advertisement.</p>
<p>My success was skaly, and I likewise had a narrer scape of my
life.</p>
<p>If what I've bin threw is "Suthren hosspitality," 'bout which
we've hearn so much, then I feel bound to obsarve that they made
two much of me.</p>
<p>They was altogether two lavish with their attenshuns.</p>
<p>I went amung the Seseshers with no feelins of annermosity.</p>
<p>I went in my perfeshernal capacity.</p>
<p>I was actooated by one of the most Loftiest desires which can
swell the human Buzzum, viz.:&mdash;to giv the peeple their money's
worth, by showin them Sagashus Beests, and Wax Statoots, which I
venter to say air onsurpast by any other statoots anywheres.</p>
<p>I will not call that man who sez my statoots is humbugs a lier
and a hoss thief, but bring him be4 me and I'll wither him with one
of my scornful frowns.</p>
<p>But to proseed with my tail.</p>
<p>In my travels threw the Sonny South I heared a heap of talk
about Seceshon and bustin up the Union, but I didn't think it
mounted to nothin.</p>
<p>The politicians in all the villages was swearin that Old Abe
(sometimes called the Prahayrie flower) shouldn't never be
noggerated.</p>
<p>They also made fools of theirselves in varis ways, but as they
was used to that I didn't let it worry me much, and the Stars and
Stripes continued for to wave over my little tent.</p>
<p>Moor over, I was a Son of Malty and a member of several other
Temperance Societies, and my wife she was a Dawter of Malty, an I
sposed these fax would secoor me the infloonz and pertectiun of all
the fust families.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; I was dispinted.</p>
<p>State arter State seseshed and it growed hotter and hotter for
the undersined.</p>
<p>Things came to a climbmacks in a small town in Alabamy, where I
was premtorally ordered to haul down the Stars &amp; Stripes.</p>
<p>A deppytashun of red-faced men cum up to the door of my tent
ware I was standin takin money (the arternoon exhibishun had
commenst, an' my Italyun organist was jerkin his sole-stirrin
chimes.)&nbsp; "We air cum, Sir," said a millingtary man in a cockt
hat, "upon a hi and holy mishun.</p>
<p>The Southern Eagle is screamin threwout this sunny
land&mdash;proudly and defiantly screamin, Sir!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with him?" sez I; "don't his vittles sit well
on his stummick?"</p>
<p>"That Eagle, Sir, will continner to scream all over this Brite
and tremenjus land!"</p>
<p>"Wall, let him <i>scream</i>.&nbsp; If your Eagle can amuse
hisself by screamin, let him went!"&nbsp; The men anoyed me, for I
was Bizzy makin change.</p>
<p>"We are cum, Sir, upon a matter of dooty&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You're right, Capting.&nbsp; It's every man's dooty to visit my
show," said I.</p>
<p>"We air cum&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And that's the reason you are here!" sez I, larfin one of my
silvery larfs.&nbsp; I thawt if he wanted to goak I'd giv him sum
of my sparklin eppygrams.</p>
<p>"Sir, you're inserlent.</p>
<p>The plain question is, will you haul down the Star-Spangled
Banner, and hist the Southern flag!"</p>
<p>"Nary hist!"&nbsp; Those was my reply.</p>
<p>"Your wax works and beests is then confisticated, &amp; you air
arrested as a Spy!"</p>
<p>Sez I, "My fragrant roses of the Southern clime and Bloomin
daffodils, what's the price of whisky in this town, and how many
cubic feet of that seductive flooid can you individooally
hold?"</p>
<p>They made no reply to that, but said my wax figgers was
confisticated.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/12.gif" alt=
"picture of Ward tied to a stake" />I axed them if that was
ginerally the stile among thieves in that country, to which they
also made no reply, but said I was arrested as a Spy, and must go
to Montgomry in iuns.&nbsp; They was by this time jined by a large
crowd of other Southern patrits, who&nbsp; commenst hollerin "Hang
the baldheaded aberlitionist, and bust up his immoral
exhibition!"&nbsp; I was ceased and tied to a stump, and the crowd
went for my tent&mdash;that water-proof pavilion, wherein
instruction and amoosment had been so muchly combined, at 15 cents
per head&mdash;and tore it all to pieces.&nbsp; Meanwhile
dirty-faced boys was throwin stuns and empty beer bottles at my
massiv brow, and takin other improper liberties with my
person.&nbsp; Resistance was useless, for a varity of reasons, as I
readily obsarved.</p>
<p>The Seseshers confisticated my statoots by smashin them to
attums.&nbsp; They then went to my money box and confisticated all
the loose change therein contaned.&nbsp; They then went and bust in
my cages, lettin all the animils loose, a small but helthy tiger
among the rest.&nbsp; This tiger has a excentric way of tearin dogs
to peaces, and I allers sposed from his gineral conduck that he'd
hav no hesitashun in servin human beins in the same way if he could
get at them.&nbsp; Excuse me if I was crooil, but I larfed
boysterrusly when I see that tiger spring in among the
people.&nbsp; "Go it, my sweet cuss!" I inardly exclaimed.&nbsp; "I
forgive you for bitin off my left thum with all my heart!&nbsp; Rip
'em up like a bully tiger whose Lare has bin inwaded by
Seseshers!"</p>
<p>I can't say for certain that the tiger serisly injured any of
them, but as he was seen a few days after, sum miles distant, with
a large and well selected assortment of seats of trowsis in his
mouth, and as he lookt as tho he'd been havin sum vilent exercise,
I rayther guess he did.&nbsp; You will therefore perceive that they
didn't confisticate him much.</p>
<p>I was carried to Montgomry in iuns and placed in durans
vial.&nbsp; The jail was a ornery edifiss, but the table was
librally surplied with Bakin an Cabbidge.&nbsp; This was a good
variety, for when I didn't hanker after Bakin I could help myself
to the cabbige.</p>
<p>I had nobody to talk to nor nothin to talk about, howsever, and
I was very lonely, specially on the first day; so when the jailer
parst my lonely sell I put the few stray hairs on the back part of
my hed (I'm bald now, but thare was a time when I wore sweet auburn
ringlets) into as dish-hevild a state as possible, &amp; rollin my
eyes like a manyyuck, I cride: "Stay, jaler, stay!&nbsp; I am not
mad, but soon shall be if you don't bring me suthin to Talk!"&nbsp;
He brung me sum noospapers, for which I thanked him kindly.</p>
<p>At larst I got a interview with Jefferson Davis, the President
of the Southern Conthieveracy.</p>
<p>He was quite perlite, and axed me to sit down and state my
case.</p>
<p>I did it, when he larfed and said his gallunt men had been a
little 2 enthoosiastic in confisticatin my show.</p>
<p>"Yes," sez I, "they confisticated me too muchly.&nbsp; I had sum
hosses confisticated in the same way onct, but the confisticaters
air now poundin stun in the States Prison in Injinnapylus."</p>
<p>"Wall, wall Mister Ward, you air at liberty to depart; you air
friendly to the South, I know.&nbsp; Even now we hav many frens in
the North, who sympathize with us, and won't mingle with this
fight."</p>
<p>"J. Davis, there's your grate mistaik.</p>
<p>Many of us was your sincere frends, and thought certin parties
amung us was fussin about you and meddlin with your consarns
intirely too much. But J. Davis, the minit you fire a gun at the
piece of dry-goods called the Star-Spangled Banner, the North gits
up and rises en massy, in defence of that banner.&nbsp; Not agin
you as individooals,&mdash;not agin the South even&mdash;but to
save the flag.&nbsp; We should indeed be weak in the knees, unsound
in the heart, milk-white in the liver, and soft in the hed, if we
stood quietly by, and saw this glorus Govyment smashed to pieces,
either by a furrin or a intestine foe.&nbsp; The gentle-harted
mother hates to take her naughty child across her knee, but she
knows it is her dooty to do it.&nbsp; So we shall hate to whip the
naughty South, but we must do it if you don't make back tracks at
onct, and we shall wallup you out of your boots!&nbsp; J. Davis, it
is my decided opinion that the Sonny South is makin a egrejus
mutton-hed of herself!"</p>
<p>"Go on, sir, you're safe enuff.&nbsp; You're two small powder
for me!" sed the President of the Southern Conthieveracy.</p>
<p>"Wait till I go home and start out the Baldinsville Mounted Hoss
Cavalry!&nbsp; I'm Capting of that Corpse, I am, and J. Davis,
beware!&nbsp; Jefferson D., I now leave you!&nbsp; Farewell my gay
Saler Boy!&nbsp; Good-bye, my bold buccaneer!&nbsp; Pirut of the
deep blue sea, adoo! adoo!"</p>
<p>My tower threw the Southern Conthieveracy on my way home was
thrillin enuff for yeller covers.&nbsp; It will form the subjeck of
my next.&nbsp; Betsy Jane and the projeny air well.</p>

<p>I had a narrer scape from the sonny South.&nbsp; "The swings and
arrers of outrajus fortin," alluded to by Hamlick, warn't nothin in
comparison to my trubles.&nbsp; I come pesky near swearin sum
profane oaths more'n onct, but I hope I didn't do it, for I've
promist she whose name shall be nameless (except that her initials
is Betsy J.) that I'll jine the Meetin House at Baldinsville, jest
as soon as I can scrape money enuff together so I can 'ford to be
piuss in good stile, like my welthy nabers.&nbsp; But if I'm
confisticated agin I'm fraid I shall continner on in my present
benited state for sum time.</p>
<p>I figgered conspicyusly in many thrillin scenes in my tower from
Montgomry to my humsted, and on sevril occasions I thought "the
grate komick paper" wouldn't be inriched no more with my
lubrications.&nbsp; Arter biddin adoo to Jefferson D. I started for
the depot.&nbsp; I saw a nigger sittin on a fence a playin on a
banjo, "My Afrikan Brother," sed I, coting from a Track I onct red,
"you belong to a very interestin race.&nbsp; Your masters is goin
to war excloosively on your account."</p>
<p>"Yes, boss," he replied, "an' I wish 'em honorable graves!" and
he went on playin the banjo, larfin all over and openin his mouth
wide enuff to drive in an old-fashioned 2 wheeled chaise.</p>
<p>The train of cars in which I was to trust my wallerable life,
was the scaliest, rickytiest lookin lot of consarns that I ever saw
on wheels afore.&nbsp; "What time does this string of second-hand
coffins leave?" I inquired of the depot master.&nbsp; He sed
direckly, and I went in &amp; sot down.&nbsp; I hadn't more'n
fairly squatted afore a dark lookin man with a swinister expression
onto his countenance entered the cars, and lookin very sharp at me,
he axed what was my principles?</p>
<p>"Secesh!" I ansered.&nbsp; "I'm a Dissoluter.&nbsp; I'm in favor
of Jeff Davis, Bowregard, Pickens, Capt. Kidd, Bloobeard, Munro
Edards, the devil, Mrs. Cunningham and all the rest of 'em."</p>
<p>"You're in favor of the war?"</p>
<p>"Certingly.&nbsp; By all means.&nbsp; I'm in favor of this war
and also of the next war.&nbsp; I've been in favor of the next war
for over sixteen years!"</p>
<p>"War to the knife!" sed the man.</p>
<p>"Blud, Eargo, Blud!" sed I, tho them words isn't orrigernal with
me, them words was rit by Shakspeare, who is ded.&nbsp; His mantle
fell onto the author of "The Seven Sisters," who's goin to hav a
Spring overcoat made out of it.</p>
<p>We got under way at larst, an' proceeded on our jerney at about
the rate of speed which is ginrally obsarved by properly-conducted
funeral processions.&nbsp; A hansum yung gal, with a red musketer
bar on the back side of her hed, and a sassy little black hat tipt
over her forrerd, sot in the seat with me.&nbsp; She wore a little
Sesesh flag pin'd onto her hat, and she was a goin for to see her
troo love, who had jined the Southern army, all so bold and
gay.&nbsp; So she told me.&nbsp; She was chilly and I offered her
my blanket.</p>
<p>"Father livin?" I axed.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Got any Uncles?"</p>
<p>"A heap.&nbsp; Uncle Thomas is ded, tho."</p>
<p>"Peace to Uncle Thomas's ashes, and success to him!&nbsp; I will
be your Uncle Thomas!&nbsp; Lean on me, my pretty Secesher, and
linger in Blissful repose!"&nbsp; She slept as secoorly as in her
own housen, and didn't disturb the sollum stillness of the night
with 'ary snore!</p>
<p>At the first station a troop of Sojers entered the cars and
inquired if "Old Wax Works" was on bored.&nbsp; That was the
disrespectiv stile in which they referred to me.&nbsp; "Becawz if
Old Wax Works is on bored," sez a man with a face like a
double-breasted lobster, "we're going to hang Old Wax Works!"</p>
<p>"My illustrious and patriotic Bummers!" sez I, a gittin up and
takin orf my Shappo, "if you allude to A. Ward, it's my pleasin
dooty to inform you that he's ded.&nbsp; He saw the error of his
ways at 15 minutes parst 2 yesterday, and stabbed hisself with a
stuffed sled-stake, dyin in five beautiful tabloos to slow
moosic!&nbsp; His last words was: 'My perfeshernal career is
over!&nbsp; I jerk no more!'"</p>
<p>"And who be you?"</p>
<p>"I'm a stoodent in Senator Benjamin's law offiss.&nbsp; I'm
going up North to steal some spoons and things for the Southern
Army."&nbsp; This was satisfactory and the intossicated troopers
went orf.&nbsp; At the next station the pretty little Secessher
awoke and sed she must git out there.&nbsp; I bid her a kind adoo
and giv her sum pervisions.&nbsp; "Accept my blessin and this hunk
of ginger bred!" I sed.&nbsp; She thankt me muchly and tript galy
away.&nbsp; There's considerable human nater in a man, and I'm
afraid I shall allers giv aid and comfort to the enemy if he cums
to me in the shape of a nice young gal.</p>
<p>At the next station I didn't get orf so easy.&nbsp; I was
dragged out of the cars and rolled in the mud for several minits,
for the purpose of "takin the conseet out of me," as a Secesher
kindly stated.&nbsp; I was let up finally, when a powerful large
Secesher came up and embraced me, and to show that he had no hard
feelins agin me, put his nose into my mouth.&nbsp; I returned the
compliment by placin my stummick suddenly agin his right foot, when
he kindly made a spittoon of his able-bodied face.&nbsp; Actooated
by a desire to see whether the Secesher had bin vaxinated I then
fastened my teeth onto his left coat-sleeve and tore it to the
shoulder.&nbsp; We then vilently bunted out heads together for a
few minutes, danced around a little, and sot down in a
mudpuddle.&nbsp; We riz to our feet agin and by a sudden and adroit
movement I placed my left eye agin the Secesher's fist.&nbsp; We
then rushed into each other's arms and fell under a two-hoss
wagon.&nbsp; I was very much exhaustid and didn't care about gettin
up agin, but the man sed he reckoned I'd better, and I conclooded I
would.&nbsp; He pulled me up, but I hadn't bin on my feet more'n
two seconds afore the ground flew up and hit me in the hed.&nbsp;
The crowd sed it was high old sport, but I couldn't zackly see
where the lafture come in.&nbsp; I riz and we embraced agin.&nbsp;
We careered madly to a steep bank, when I got the upper hands of my
antaggernist and threw him into the raveen.&nbsp; He fell about
forty feet, striking a grindstone pretty hard.&nbsp; I understood
he was injured.&nbsp; I haven't heard from the grindstone.</p>
<p>A man in a cockt hat cum up and sed he felt as though a apology
was doo me.&nbsp; There was a mistake.&nbsp; The crowd had taken me
for another man!&nbsp; I told him not to mention it, and axed him
if his wife and little ones was so as to be about, and got on bored
the train, which had stopped at that station "20 minits for
refreshments."&nbsp; I got all I wantid.&nbsp; It was the hartiest
meal I ever et.</p>
<p>I was rid on a rale the next day, a bunch of blazin fire
crackers bein tied to my coat tales.&nbsp; It was a fine spectycal
in a dramatic pint of view, but I didn't enjoy it.&nbsp; I had
other adventers of a startlin kind, but why continner?&nbsp; Why
lasserate the Public Boozum with these here things?&nbsp; Suffysit
to say I got across Mason &amp; Dixie's line safe at last.&nbsp; I
made tracks for my humsted, but she to whom I'm harnist for life
failed to recognize, in the emashiated bein who stood before her,
the gushin youth of forty-six summers who had left her only a few
months afore.&nbsp; But I went into the pantry, and brought out a
certin black bottle.&nbsp; Raisin it to my lips, I sed "Here's to
you, old gal!"&nbsp; I did it so natral that she knowed me at
once.&nbsp; "Those form!&nbsp; Them voice!&nbsp; That natral stile
of doin things!&nbsp; 'Tis he!" she cried, and rushed into my
arms.&nbsp; It was too much for her &amp; she fell into a
swoon.&nbsp; I cum very near swoundin myself.</p>

the world over, and to be axed to paws and address you on this my
fust perfeshernal tower threw New Englan, causes me to
feel&mdash;to feel&mdash;I may say it causes me to FEEL. (Grate
applaws.&nbsp; They thought this was one of my eccentricities,
while the fact is I was stuck.&nbsp; This between you and I.)</p>
<p>I'm a plane man.&nbsp; I don't know nothin about no ded
languages and am a little shaky on livin ones.&nbsp; There4, expect
no flowry talk from me.&nbsp; What I shall say will be to the pint,
right strate out.</p>
<p>I'm not a politician and my other habits air good.&nbsp; I've no
enemys to reward, nor friends to sponge.&nbsp; But I'm a Union
man.&nbsp; I luv the Union&mdash;it is a Big thing&mdash;and it
makes my hart bleed to see a lot of ornery peple a-movin
heaven&mdash;no, not heaven, but the other place&mdash;and earth,
to bust it up.&nbsp; Toe much good blud was spilt in courtin and
marryin that hily respectable female the Goddess of Liberty, to git
a divorce from her now.&nbsp; My own State of Injianny is
celebrated for unhitchin marrid peple with neatness and dispatch,
but you can't get a divorce from the Goddess up there.&nbsp; Not by
no means.&nbsp; The old gal has behaved herself too well to cast
her off now.&nbsp; I'm sorry the picters don't give her no shoes or
stockins, but the band of stars upon her hed must continner to
shine undimd, forever.&nbsp; I'm for the Union as she air, and
withered be the arm of every ornery cuss who attempts to bust her
up.&nbsp; That's me.&nbsp;I hav sed!&nbsp; [It was a very sweaty
day, and at this pint of the orashun a man fell down with
sunstroke.&nbsp; I told the awjince that considerin the large
number of putty gals present I was more afraid of a DAWTER
STROKE.&nbsp; This was impromptoo, and seemed to amoose them very
much.]</p>
<p>Feller Citizens&mdash;I hain't got time to notis the growth of
Ameriky frum the time when the Mayflowers cum over in the Pilgrim
and brawt Plymouth Rock with them, but every skool boy nose our
kareer has been tremenjis.&nbsp; You will excuse me if I don't
prase the erly settlers of the Kolonies.&nbsp; Peple which hung
idiotic old wimin for witches, burnt holes in Quakers' tongues and
consined their feller critters to the tredmill and pillery on the
slitest provocashun may hav bin very nice folks in their way, but I
must confess I don't admire their stile, and will pass them
by.&nbsp; I spose they ment well, and so, in the novel and techin
langwidge of the nusepapers, "peas to their ashis."&nbsp; Thare was
no diskount, however, on them brave men who fit, bled and died in
the American Revolushun.&nbsp; We needn't be afraid of setting 'em
up two steep.&nbsp; Like my show, they will stand any amount of
prase.&nbsp; G. Washington was abowt the best man this world ever
sot eyes on.&nbsp; He was a clear-heded, warm-harted, and stiddy
goin man.&nbsp; He never slopt over! The prevailin weakness of most
public men is to SLOP OVER!&nbsp; [Put them words in large
letters&mdash;A. W.]&nbsp; They git filled up and slop.&nbsp; They
Rush Things.&nbsp; They travel too much on the high presher
principle.&nbsp; They git on to the fust poplar hobbyhoss whitch
trots along, not carin a sent whether the beest is even goin, clear
sited and sound or spavined, blind and bawky.&nbsp; Of course they
git throwed eventooally, if not sooner.&nbsp; When they see the
multitood goin it blind they go Pel Mel with it, instid of exerting
theirselves to set it right.&nbsp; They can't see that the crowd
which is now bearin them triumfantly on its shoulders will soon
diskiver its error and cast them into the hoss pond of Oblivyun,
without the slitest hesitashun.&nbsp; Washington never slopt
over.&nbsp; That wasn't George's stile.&nbsp; He luved his country
dearly.&nbsp; He wasn't after the spiles.&nbsp; He was a human
angil in a 3 kornerd hat and knee britches, and we shan't see his
like right away.&nbsp; My frends, we can't all be Washingtons but
we kin all be patrits &amp; behave ourselves in a human and a
Christian manner.&nbsp; When we see a brother goin down hill to
Ruin let us not give him a push, but let us seeze rite hold of his
coat tails and draw him back to Morality.</p>
<p>Imagine G. Washington and P. Henry in the character of
seseshers!&nbsp; As well fancy John Bunyan and Dr. Watts in
spangled tites, doin the trapeze in a one-horse circus!&nbsp; I
tell you, feller-citizens, it would have bin ten dollars in Jeff
Davis's pocket if he'd never bin born!</p>

<p><a name="fever" id="fever"></a>THE WAR FEVER IN
BALDINSVILLE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>As soon as I'd recooperated my physikil system, I went over into
the village.&nbsp; The peasantry was glad to see me.&nbsp; The
skoolmaster sed it was cheerin to see that gigantic intelleck among
'em onct more.&nbsp; That's what he called me.&nbsp; I like the
skoolmaster, and allers send him tobacker when I'm off on a
travelin campane.&nbsp; Besides, he is a very sensible man.&nbsp;
Such men must be encouraged.</p>
<p>They don't git news very fast in Baldinsville, as nothin but a
plank road runs in there twice a week, and that's very much out of
repair.&nbsp; So my nabers wasn't much posted up in regard to the
wars.&nbsp; 'Squire Baxter sed he'd voted the dimicratic ticket for
goin on forty year, and the war was a dam black republican
lie.&nbsp; Jo. Stackpole, who kills hogs for the Squire, and has
got a powerful muscle into his arms, sed he'd bet 5 dollars he
could lick the Crisis in a fair stand-up fight, if he wouldn't draw
a knife on him.&nbsp; So it went&mdash;sum was for war, and sum was
for peace.&nbsp; The skoolmaster, however, sed the Slave Oligarky
must cower at the feet of the North ere a year had flowed by, or
pass over his dead corpse.&nbsp; "Esto perpetua!" he added! "And
sine qua non also!" sed I, sternly, wishing to make a impression
onto the villagers.&nbsp;"Requiescat in pace!" sed the skoolmaster,
"Too troo, too troo!" I anserd, "it's a scanderlus fact!"</p>
<p>The newspapers got along at last, chock full of war, and the
patriotic fever fairly bust out in Baldinsville.&nbsp; 'Squire
Baxter sed he didn't b'lieve in Coercion, not one of 'em, and could
prove by a file of "Eagles of Liberty" in his garrit, that it was
all a Whig lie, got up to raise the price of whisky and destroy our
other liberties.&nbsp; But the old 'Squire got putty riley, when he
heard how the rebels was cuttin up, and he sed he reckoned he
should skour up his old muskit and do a little square fitin for the
Old Flag, which had allers bin on the ticket <i>he'd</i> voted, and
he was too old to Bolt now.&nbsp; The 'Squire is all right at
heart, but it takes longer for him to fill his venerable Biler with
steam than it used to when he was young and frisky.&nbsp; As I
previously informed you, I am Captin of the Baldinsville
Company.&nbsp; I riz gradooally but majestically from drummer's
Secretary to my present position. But I found the ranks wasn't full
by no means, and commenced for to recroot.&nbsp; Havin notist a
gineral desire on the part of young men who are into the crisis to
wear eppylits, I detarmined to have my company composed
excloosviely of offissers, everybody to rank as
Brigadeer-Ginral.&nbsp; The follerin was among the varis questions
which I put to recroots:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know a masked battery from a hunk of
gingerbread?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know a eppylit from a piece of chalk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I trust you with a real gun, how many men of your
own company do you speck you can manage to kill durin the war?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hav you ever heard of Ginral Price of Missouri, and
can you avoid simler accidents in case of a battle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever had the measles, and if so, how
many?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How air you now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Show me your tongue, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; Sum of
the questions was sarcusstical.</p>
<p>The company filled up rapid, and last Sunday we went to the
meetin house in full uniform.&nbsp; I had a seris time gittin into
my military harness, as it was bilt for me many years ago; but I
finally got inside of it, tho' it fitted me putty clost.&nbsp;
Howsever, onct into it, I lookt fine&mdash;in fact, aw-inspirin.
"Do you know me, Mrs. Ward?" sed I, walking into the kitchin.</p>
<p>"Know you, you old fool? Of course I do."</p>
<p>I saw at once she did.</p>
<p>I started for the meetin house, and I'm afraid I tried to walk
too strate, for I cum very near fallin over backards; and in
attemptin to recover myself, my sword got mixed up with my legs,
and I fell in among a choice collection of young ladies, who was
standin near the church door a-seein the sojer boys come up.&nbsp;
My cockt hat fell off, and sumhow my coat tales got twisted round
my neck.&nbsp; The young ladies put their handkerchers to their
mouths and remarked: "Te he," while my ancient female single
friend, Sary Peasley, bust out in a loud larf.&nbsp; She exercised
her mouth so vilently that her new false teeth fell out onto the
ground.</p>
<p>"Miss Peaseley," sed I, gittin up and dustin myself, "you must
be more careful with them store teeth of your'n or you'll have to
gum it agin!"</p>
<p>Methinks I had her.</p>
<p>I'd bin to work hard all the week, and I felt rather snoozy. I'm
'fraid I did git half asleep, for on hearin the minister ask, "Why
was man made to mourn?" I sed, "I giv it up," havin a vague idee
that it was a condrum.&nbsp; It was a onfortnit remark, for the
whole meetin house lookt at me with mingled surprise and
indignation.&nbsp; I was about risin to a pint of order, when it
suddenly occurd to me whare I was, and I kept my seat, blushin like
the red, red rose&mdash;so to speak.</p>
<p>The next mornin I 'rose with the lark (N.B.&mdash;I don't sleep
with the lark, tho.' A goak).</p>
<p>My little dawter was execootin ballids, accompanyin herself with
the Akordeon, and she wisht me to linger and hear her sing: "Hark I
hear a angel singin, a angel now is onto the wing."</p>
<p>"Let him fly, my child!" sed I, a-bucklin on my armer; "I must
forth to my Biz."</p>
<p>We air progressin pretty well with our drill.&nbsp; As all air
commandin offissers, there ain't no jelusy, and as we air all
exceedin smart, it t'aint worth while to try to outstrip each
other.&nbsp; The idee of a company composed excloosively of
Commanders-in-Chiefs, orriggernated, I spose I skurcely need say,
in these Brane.&nbsp; Considered AS a idee, I flatter myself it is
putty hefty.&nbsp; We've got all the tackticks at our tongs' ends,
but what we particly excel in is restin muskits.&nbsp; We can rest
muskits with anybody.</p>
<p>Our corpse will do its dooty.&nbsp; We go to the aid of
Columby&mdash;we fight for the stars!</p>
<p>We'll be chopt into sassige meat before we'll exhibit our
cote-tales to the foe.</p>
<p>We'll fight till there's nothin left of us but our little toes
and even they shall defiantly wiggle!</p>

<p><a name="meeting" id="meeting"></a>A WAR MEETING.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Our complaint just now is war meetin's.&nbsp; They've bin havin
'em bad in varis parts of our cheerful Republic, and nat'rally we
caught 'em here in Baldinsville.&nbsp; They broke out all over
us.&nbsp; They're better attended than the Eclipse was.</p>
<p>I remember how people poured into our town last Spring to see
the Eclipse.&nbsp; They labored into a impression that they
couldn't see it to home, and so they cum up to our place.&nbsp; I
cleared a very handsome amount of money by exhibitin' the Eclipse
to 'em, in an open-top tent.&nbsp; But the crowds is bigger
now.&nbsp; Posey County is aroused.&nbsp; I may say, indeed, that
the pra-hay-ories of Injianny is on fire.</p>
<p>Our big meetin' came off the other night, and our old friend of
the <i>Bugle</i> was elected Cheerman.</p>
<p>The <i>Bugle-Horn of Liberty</i> is one of Baldinsville's most
eminentest institootions.&nbsp; The advertisements are
well-written, and the deaths and marriages are conducted with
signal ability.&nbsp; The editor, MR. SLINKERS, is a polish'd,
skarcastic writer.&nbsp; Folks in these parts will not soon forgit
how he used up the <i>Eagle of Freedom</i>, a family journal
published at Snootville, near here.&nbsp; The controversy was about
a plank road.&nbsp; "The road may be, as our cotemporary says, a
humbug; but <i>our</i> aunt isn't bald-heded, and <i>we</i> haven't
got a one-eyed sister Sal!&nbsp; Wonder if the Editor of the
<i>Eagle of Freedom</i> sees it?"&nbsp; This used up the <i>Eagle
of Freedom</i> feller, because his aunt's head does present a
skinn'd appearance, and his sister SARAH is very much
one-eyed.&nbsp; For a genteel home-thrust, MR. SLINKERS has few
ekals.&nbsp; He is a man of great pluck likewise.&nbsp; He has a
fierce nostril, and I believe upon my soul that if it wasn't
absolootly necessary for him to remain here and announce in his
paper, from week to week, that "our Gov'ment is about to take
vig'rous measures to put down the rebellion"&mdash;I b'lieve, upon
my soul, this illustris man would enlist as a Brigadier Gin'ral,
and git his Bounty.</p>
<center>___________</center>
<p><img align="left" src="images/13.gif" alt=
"picture of Ward, his daughter and the painter." />I was fixin
myself up to attend the great war meetin', when my daughter entered
with a young man who was evijently from the city, and who wore long
hair, and had a wild expression into his eye.&nbsp; In one hand he
carried a port-folio, and his other paw claspt a bunch of small
brushes.&nbsp; My daughter introduced him as MR. SWEIBIER, the
distinguished landscape painter from Philadelphy.</p>
<p>"He is a artist, papa.&nbsp; Here is one of his
master-pieces&mdash;a young mother gazin' admirin'ly upon her
first-born," and my daughter showed me a really pretty picter, done
in ile.&nbsp; "Is it not beautiful, papa?&nbsp; He throws so much
soul into his work."</p>
<p>"Does he? does he?" said I&mdash;"well, I reckon I'd better hire
him to whitewash our fence.&nbsp; It needs it.&nbsp; What will you
charge, sir," I continued, "to throw some soul into my fence?"</p>
<p>My daughter went out of the room in very short meeter, takin'
the artist with her, and from the emphatical manner in which the
door slam'd, I concluded she was summat disgusted at my
remarks.&nbsp; She closed the door, I may say, in
<i>italics</i>.&nbsp; I went into the closet and larfed all alone
by myself for over half an hour.&nbsp; I larfed so vi'lently that
the preserve jars rattled like a cavalry offisser's sword and
things, which it aroused my BETSY, who came and opened the door
pretty suddent.&nbsp; She seized me by the few lonely hairs that
still linger sadly upon my bare-footed hed, and dragged me out of
the closet, incidentally obsarving that she didn't exactly see why
she should be compelled, at her advanced stage of life, to open a
assylum for sooperanooated idiots.</p>
<p>My wife is one of the best wimin on this continent, altho' she
isn't always gentle as a lamb, with mint sauce.&nbsp; No, not
always.</p>
<p>But to return to the war meetin'.&nbsp; It was largely
attended.&nbsp; The Editor of the <i>Bugle</i> arose and got up and
said the fact could no longer be disguised that we were involved in
a war.&nbsp; "Human gore," said he, "is flowin'.&nbsp; All
able-bodied men should seize a musket and march to the tented
field.&nbsp; I repeat it sir, to the tented field."</p>
<p>A voice&mdash;"Why don't you go yourself, you old blowhard?"</p>
<p>"I am identified, young man, with a Arkymedian leaver which
moves the world," said the Editor, wiping his auburn brow with his
left coat-tail; "I allude, young man, to the press: Terms, two
dollars a year, invariably in advance.&nbsp; Job printing executed
with neatness and dispatch!"&nbsp; And with this brilliant bust of
elekance the Editor introduced Mr. J. Brutus Hinkins, who is
suffering from an attack of College in a naberin' place.&nbsp; Mr.
Hinkins said Washington was not safe.&nbsp; Who can save our
national capeetle?</p>
<p>"DAN SETCHELL," I said.&nbsp; "He can do it afternoons.&nbsp;
Let him plant his light and airy form onto the Long Bridge, make
faces at the hirelin' foe, and they'll skedaddle!&nbsp; Old SETCH
can do it."</p>
<p>"I call the Napoleon of Showmen," said the Editor of the
<i>Bugle</i>,&mdash;"I call that Napoleonic man, whose life is
adorned with so many noble virtues, and whose giant mind lights up
this warlike scene&mdash;I call him to order."</p>
<p>I will remark, in this connection, that the Editor of the
"Bugle" does my job printing.</p>
<p>"You," said Mr. Hinkins, "who live away from the busy haunts of
men do not comprehend the magnitood of the crisis.&nbsp; The busy
haunts of men is where people comprehend this crisis.&nbsp; We who
live in the busy haunts of men&mdash;that is to say, we dwell, as
it were, in the busy haunts of men."</p>
<p>"I really trust that the gen'l'man will not fail to say suthin'
about the busy haunts of men before he sits down," said I.</p>
<p>"I claim the right to express my sentiments here," said Mr.
Hinkins, in a slightly indignant tone, "and I shall brook no
interruption, if I am a Softmore."</p>
<p>"You couldn't be <i>more soft</i>, my young friend," I observed,
whereupon there was cries of Order! order!"</p>
<p>"I regret I can't mingle in this strife personally," said the
young man.</p>
<p>"You might inlist as a liberty-pole," said I, in a silvery
whisper.</p>
<p>"But," he added, "I have a voice, and that voice is for
war."&nbsp; The young man then closed his speech with some strikin
and orginal remarks in relation to the star-spangled banner.&nbsp;
He was followed by the village minister, a very worthy man indeed,
but whose sermons have a tendency to make people sleep pretty
industriously.</p>
<p>"I am willin' to inlist for one," he said.</p>
<p>"What's your weight, parson?" I asked.</p>
<p>"A hundred and sixty pounds," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, you can inlist as a hundred and sixty pounds of morphine,
your dooty bein' to stand in the hospitals arter a battle, and
preach while the surgical operations is bein' performed!&nbsp;
Think how much you'd save the Gov'ment in morphine."</p>
<p>He didn't seem to see it; but he made a good speech, and the
editor of the <i>Bugle</i> rose to read the resolutions, commencin'
as follers:</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That we view with anxiety the fact that there is now a
war goin' on, and</p>
<p>RESOLVED, That we believe Stonewall Jackson sympathizes with the
secession movement, and that we hope the nine-months men&mdash;</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/14.gif" alt=
"picture of Betsy Jane and her 'army'" />At this point he was
interrupted by the sounds of silvery footsteps on the stairs, and a
party of wimin, carryin' guns and led by BETSY JANE, who brandish'd
a loud and rattlin' umbereller, burst into the room.</p>
<p>"Here," cried I, "are some nine-months wimin!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ward," said the editor of the <i>Bugle</i>&mdash;"Mrs.
WARD and ladies, what means this extr'ord'n'ry demonstration?"</p>
<p>"It means," said that remarkable female "that you men air makin'
fools of yourselves.&nbsp; You air willin' to talk and urge others
to go to the wars, but you don't go to the wars yourselves.&nbsp;
War meetin's is very nice in their way, but they don't keep
STONEWALL JACKSON from comin' over to Maryland and helpin' himself
to the fattest beef critters.&nbsp; What we want is more cider and
less talk.&nbsp; We want you able-bodied men to stop speechifying,
which don't 'mount to the wiggle of a sick cat's tail, and to go
fi'tin'; otherwise you can stay to home and take keer of the
children, while we wimin will go to the wars!"</p>
<p>"Gentl'man," said I, "that's my wife!&nbsp; Go in, old gal!" and
I throw'd up my ancient white hat in perfeck rapters.</p>
<p>"Is this roll-book to be filled up with the names of men or
wimin?" she cried.</p>
<p>"With men&mdash;with men!" and our quoty was made up that very
night.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of gas about these war meetin's.&nbsp; A
war meetin', in fact, without gas, would be suthin' like the play
of HAMLET with the part of OTHELLO omitted.</p>
<p>Still believin' that the Goddess of Liberty is about as well sot
up with as any young lady in distress could expect to be, I am</p>

<i>other</i> sowin' circle (which likewise met that arternoon, and
was doubtless enjoyin' theirselves ekally well in slanderin' the
fust-named circle), and I didn't send for her.&nbsp; I allus like
to see people enjoy theirselves.</p>
<p>My son ORGUSTUS was playin' onto a floot.</p>
<p>ORGUSTUS is a ethereal cuss.&nbsp; The twins was bildin'
cob-houses in a corner of the kitchin'.</p>
<p>It'll cost some postage-stamps to raise this fam'ly, and yet it
'ud go hard with the old man to lose any lamb of the flock.</p>
<p>An old bachelor is a poor critter.&nbsp; He may have hearn the
skylark or (what's nearly the same thing) MISS KELLOGG and CARLOTTY
PATTI sing; he may have hearn OLE BULL fiddle, and all the
DODWORTHS toot, an' yet he don't know nothin' about music&mdash;the
real, ginuine thing&mdash;the music of the laughter of happy,
well-fed children!&nbsp; And you may ax the father of sich children
home to dinner, feelin werry sure there'll be no spoons missin'
when he goes away.&nbsp; Sich fathers never drop tin five-cent
pieces into the contribution box, nor palm shoe-pegs off onto blind
hosses for oats, nor skedaddle to British sile when their country's
in danger&mdash;nor do anything which is really mean.&nbsp; I don't
mean to intimate that the old bachelor is up to little games of
this sort&mdash;not at all&mdash;but I repeat, he's a poor
critter.&nbsp; He don't live here; only stays.&nbsp; He ought to
'pologize on behalf of his parients, for bein' here at all.&nbsp;
The happy marrid man dies in good stile at home, surrounded by his
weeping wife and children.&nbsp; The old bachelor don't die at
all&mdash;he sort of rots away, like a pollywog's tail.</p>
<center>____________</center>
<p>My townsmen were sort o' demoralized.&nbsp; There was a evident
desine to ewade the Draft, as I obsarved with sorrer, and patritism
was below Par&mdash;and <i>Mar</i>, too.&nbsp; [A jew
desprit.]&nbsp; I hadn't no sooner sot down on the piazzy of the
tavoun than I saw sixteen solitary hossmen, ridin' four abreast,
wendin' their way up the street.</p>
<p>"What's them?&nbsp; Is it cavilry?"</p>
<p>"That," said the landlord, "is the stage.&nbsp; Sixteen
able-bodied citizens has literally bo't the stage line 'tween here
and Scotsburg.&nbsp; That's them.&nbsp; They're
Stage-drivers.&nbsp; Stage-drivers is exempt!"</p>
<p>I saw that each stage-driver carried a letter in his left
hand.</p>
<p>"The mail is hevy, to-day," said the landlord.&nbsp; "Gin'rally
they don't have more'n half a dozen letters 'tween 'em.&nbsp;
To-day they're got one a piece!&nbsp; Bile my lights and
liver!"</p>
<p>"And the passengers?"</p>
<p>"There ain't any, skacely, now-days," said the landlord, "and
what few ther is very much prefer to walk, the roads is so
rough."</p>
<p>"And how ist with you?" I inquired of the editor of the
<i>Bugle-Horn of Liberty,</i> who sot near me.</p>
<p>"I can't go," he said, shakin' his head in a wise way.
"Ordinarily I should delight to wade in gore, but my bleedin'
country bids me stay at home.&nbsp; It is imperatively necessary
that I remain here for the purpose of announcin', from week to
week, that <i>our Gov'ment is about to take vigorous measures to
put down the rebellion!</i></p>
<p>I strolled into the village oyster-saloon, where I found Dr.
SCHWAZEY, a leadin' citizen in a state of mind which showed that
he'd bin histin' in more'n his share of pizen.</p>
<p>"Hello, old Beeswax," he bellered; "how's yer grandmams?&nbsp;
When you goin' to feed your stuffed animils?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with the eminent physician?" I pleasantly
inquired.</p>
<p>"This," he said; "this is what's the matter.&nbsp; I'm a
habit-ooal drunkard!&nbsp; I'm exempt!"</p>
<p>"Jes' so."</p>
<p>"Do you see them beans, old man?" and he pinted to a plate
before him.&nbsp; "Do you see 'em?"</p>
<p>"I do.&nbsp; They are a cheerful fruit when used tempritly."</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "I hadn't eat anything since last week.&nbsp; I
eat beans now <i>because</i> I eat beans <i>then</i>.&nbsp; I never
mix my vittles!"</p>
<p>"It's quite proper you should eat a little suthin' once in a
while," I said.&nbsp; "It's a good idee to occasionally instruct
the stummick that it mustn't depend excloosively on licker for its
sustainance."</p>
<p>"A blessin'," he cried; "a blessin' onto the hed of the man what
invented beans.&nbsp; A blessin' onto his hed!"</p>
<p>"Which his name is GILSON! He's a first family of Bostin," said
I.</p>
<center>
<p>____________</p>
</center>
<p>This is a speciment of how things was goin' in my place of
residence.</p>
<p>A few was true blue.&nbsp; The schoolmaster was among 'em.&nbsp;
He greeted me warmly.&nbsp; He said I was welkim to those
shores.&nbsp; He said I had a massiv mind.&nbsp; It was gratifyin',
he said, to see the great intelleck stalkin' in their midst onct
more.&nbsp; I have before had occasion to notice this
schoolmaster.&nbsp; He is evidently a young man of far more than
ord'nary talents.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster proposed we should git up a mass meetin'.&nbsp;
The meetin' was largely attended.&nbsp; We held it in the open air
round a roarin' bonfire.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster was the first orator.&nbsp; He's pretty good on
the speak.&nbsp; He also writes well, his composition bein' seldom
marred by ingrammatticisms.&nbsp; He said this inactivity surprised
him.&nbsp; "What do you expect will come of this kind of
doin's?&nbsp; <i>Nihil fit</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hooray for Nihil!" I interrupted.&nbsp; "Fellow-citizens, let's
giv three cheers for Nihil, the man who fit!"</p>
<p>The schoolmaster turned a little red, but
repeated&mdash;<i>Nihil fit.</i></p>
<p>"Exactly," I said.&nbsp; "Nihil <i>fit</i>.&nbsp; He wasn't a
strategy feller."</p>
<p>"Our venerable friend," said the schoolmaster, smilin'
pleasantly, "isn't posted in Virgil."</p>
<p>"No, I don't know him.&nbsp; But if he's a able-bodied man he
must stand his little draft."</p>
<p>The schoolmaster wound up in eloquent style, and the subscriber
took the stand.</p>
<p>I said the crisis had not only cum itself, but it had brought
all its relations.&nbsp; It has cum, I said, with a evident
intention of makin' us a good long visit.&nbsp; It's goin' to take
off its things and stop with us.&nbsp; My wife says so too.&nbsp;
This is a good war.&nbsp; For those who like this war, it's just
such a kind of war as they like.&nbsp; I'll bet ye.&nbsp; My wife
says so too.&nbsp; If the Federal army succeeds in takin'
Washington, and they seem to be advancin' that way pretty often, I
shall say it is strategy, and Washington will be safe.&nbsp; And
that noble banner, as it were&mdash;that banner, as it
were&mdash;will be a emblem, or rather, I should say, that noble
banner&mdash;as it were.&nbsp; My wife says so too.&nbsp; [I got a
little mixed up here, but they didn't notice it.&nbsp; Keep
mum.]&nbsp; Feller citizens, it will be a proud day for this
Republic when Washington is safe.&nbsp; My wife says so too.</p>
<p>The editor of the <i>Bugle-Horn of Liberty</i> here arose and
said: "I do not wish to interrupt the gentleman, but a impertant
despatch has just bin received at the telegraph office here. I will
read it.&nbsp; It is as follows: <i>Gov'ment is about to take
vigorous measures to put down the rebellion!</i> [Loud
applause.]</p>
<p>That, said I, is cheering.&nbsp; That's soothing.&nbsp; And
Washington will be safe.&nbsp; [Sensation.]&nbsp; Philadelphia is
safe.&nbsp; Gen. PATTERSON'S in Philadelphia.&nbsp; But my heart
bleeds partic'ly for Washington.&nbsp; My wife says so too.</p>
<p>There's money enough.&nbsp; No trouble about <i>money</i>.&nbsp;
They've got a lot of first-class bank-note engravers at Washington
(which place, I regret to say, is by no means safe) who turn out
two or three cords of money a day&mdash;good money, too.&nbsp; Goes
well.&nbsp; These bank-note engravers made good wages.&nbsp; I
expect they lay up property.&nbsp; They are full of Union
sentiment.&nbsp; There is considerable Union sentiment in Virginny,
more especially among the honest farmers of the Shenandoah
valley.&nbsp; My wife says so too.</p>
<p>Then it isn't money we want.&nbsp; But we do want <i>men</i>,
and we must have them.&nbsp; We must carry a whirlwind of fire
among the foe.&nbsp; We must crush the ungrateful rebels who are
poundin' the Goddess of Liberty over the head with slung-shots, and
stabbin' her with stolen knives!&nbsp; We must lick 'em
quick.&nbsp; We must introduce a large number of first-class
funerals among the people of the South.&nbsp; Betsy says so
too.</p>
<p>This war hain't been too well managed.&nbsp; We all know
that.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; We are all in the same boat&mdash;if
the boat goes down, we go down with her.&nbsp; Hence we must all
fight.&nbsp; It ain't no use to talk now about who <i>caused</i>
the war.&nbsp; That's played out.&nbsp; The war is upon
us&mdash;upon us all&mdash;and we must all fight.&nbsp; We can't
"reason" the matter with the foe.&nbsp; When, in the broad glare of
the noonday sun, a speckled jackass boldly and maliciously kicks
over a peanut-stand, do we "reason" with him?&nbsp; I guess
not.&nbsp; And why "reason" with those other Southern people who
are trying to kick over the Republic!&nbsp; Betsy, my wife, says so
too.</p>
<p>The meeting broke up with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We shan't draft in Baldinsville if we can help it.</p>

<p><a name="cornwallis" id="cornwallis"></a>SURRENDER OF
CORNWALLIS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>It was customary in many of the inland towns of New England,
some thirty years ago, to celebrate the anniversary of the
surrender of Lord Cornwallis by a sham representation of that
important event in the history of the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; A
town meeting would be called, at which a company of men would be
detailed as British, and a company as Americans&mdash;two leading
citizens being selected to represent Washington and Cornwallis in
mimic surrender.</p>
<p>The pleasant little town of W&mdash;&mdash;, in whose schools
the writer has been repeatedly "corrected," upon whose ponds he has
often skated, upon whose richest orchards he has, with other
juvenile bandits, many times dashed in the silent midnight; the
town of W&mdash;&mdash;, where it was popularly believed these
bandits would "come to a bad end," resolved to celebrate the
surrender.&nbsp; Rival towns had celebrated, and W&mdash;&mdash;
determined to eclipse them in the most signal manner.&nbsp; It is
my privilege to tell how W&mdash;&mdash; succeeded in this
determination.</p>
<p>The great day came.&nbsp; It was ushered in by the roar of
musketry, the ringing of the village church bell, the squeaking of
fifes, and the rattling of drums.</p>
<p>People poured into the village from all over the county. Never
had W&mdash;&mdash;experienced such a jam.&nbsp; Never had there
been such an onslaught upon gingerbread carts.&nbsp; Never had New
England rum (for this was before Neal Dow's day) flowed so
freely.&nbsp; And W&mdash;&mdash;'s fair daughters, who mounted the
house-tops to see the surrender, had never looked fairer.&nbsp; The
old folks came, too, and among them were several war-scarred
heroes, who had fought gallantly at Monmouth and Yorktown.&nbsp;
These brave sons of '76 took no part in the demonstration, but an
honored bench was set apart for their exclusive use on the piazza
of Sile Smith's store.&nbsp; When they were dry, all they had to do
was to sing out to Sile's boy, Jerry, "a leetle New Englan' this
way, if <i>you</i> please."&nbsp; It was brought forthwith.</p>
<p>At precisely 9 o'clock, by the schoolmaster's new "Lepeen"
watch, the American and British forces marched on to the village
green and placed themselves in battle array, reminding the
spectator of the time when</p>
<center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brave Wolfe drew up his men<br />
In a style most pretty,<br />
On the Plains of Abraham<br />
Before the city."</p>
</center>
<p>The character of Washington had been assigned to 'Squire Wood, a
well-to-do and influential farmer, while that of Cornwallis had
been given to the village lawyer, a kind-hearted but rather pompous
person, whose name was Caleb Jones.</p>
<p>'Squire Wood, the Washington of the occasion, had met with many
unexpected difficulties in preparing his forces, and in his
perplexity he had emptied not only his own canteen but those of
most of his aids.&nbsp; The consequence was&mdash;mortifying as it
must be to all true Americans&mdash;blushing as I do to tell it,
Washington at the commencement of the mimic struggle was most
unqualifiedly drunk.</p>
<p>The sham fight commenced.&nbsp; Bang! bang! bang! from the
Americans&mdash;bang! bang! bang! from the British.&nbsp; The bangs
were kept hotly up until the powder gave out, and then came the
order to charge.&nbsp; Hundreds of wooden bayonets flashed fiercely
in the sunlight, each soldier taking very good care not to hit
anybody.</p>
<p>"Thaz (hic) right," shouted Washington, who during the shooting
had been racing his horse wildly up and down the line, "thaz
right!&nbsp; GIN it to 'em!&nbsp; Cut their tarnal heads off!"</p>
<p>"On, Romans!" shrieked Cornwallis, who had once seen a
theatrical performance and remembered the heroic appeals of the
Thespian belligerents, "on to the fray!&nbsp; No sleep till
mornin'."</p>
<p>"Let eout all their bowels," yelled Washington, "and down with
taxation on tea!"</p>
<p>The fighting now ceased, the opposing forces were properly
arranged, and Cornwallis, dismounting, prepared to present his
sword to Washington according to programme.&nbsp; As he walked
slowly towards the Father of His Country he rehearsed the little
speech he had committed for the occasion, while the illustrious
being who was to hear it was making desperate efforts to keep in
his saddle.&nbsp; Now he would wildly brandish his sword and
narrowly escape cutting off his horse's ears, and then he would
fall suddenly forward on to the steed's neck, grasping the mane as
drowning men seize hold of straws.&nbsp; He was giving an
inimitable representation of Toodles on horseback.&nbsp; All idea
of the magnitude of the occasion had left him, and when he saw
Cornwallis approaching, with slow and stately step, and sword-hilt
extended toward him, he inquired,</p>
<p>"What'n devil <i>you</i> want, any (hic) how!"</p>
<p>"General Washington," said Cornwallis, in dignified and
impressive tones, "I tender you my sword.&nbsp; I need not inform
you, Sir, how deeply&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speech was here suddenly cut short by Washington, who,
driving the spurs into his horse, playfully attempted to ride over
the commander of the British forces.&nbsp; He was not permitted to
do this, for his aids, seeing his unfortunate condition, seized the
horse by the bridle, straightened Washington up in his saddle, and
requested Cornwallis to proceed with his remarks.</p>
<p>"General Washington," said Cornwallis, "the British Lion
prostrates himself at the feet of the American Eagle!"</p>
<p>"<i>Eagle?</i> EAGLE!" yelled the infuriated Washington, rolling
off his horse and hitting Cornwallis a frightful blow on the head
with the flat of his sword, "do you call me a EAGLE, you mean,
sneakin' cuss?"&nbsp; He struck him again, sending him to the
ground, and said, "I'll learn you to call me a Eagle, you infernal
scoundrel!"</p>
<p>Cornwallis remained upon the ground only a moment.&nbsp;
Smarting from the blows he had received, he arose with an entirely
unlooked for recuperation on the part of the fallen, and in direct
defiance of historical example; in spite of the men of both
nations, indeed, he whipped the Immortal Washington until he roared
for mercy.</p>
<p>The Americans, at first mortified and indignant at the conduct
of their chief, now began to sympathize with him, and resolved to
whip their mock foes in earnest.&nbsp; They rushed fiercely upon
them, but the British were really the stronger party and drove the
Americans back.&nbsp; Not content with this they charged madly upon
them and drove them from the field&mdash;from the village, in
fact.&nbsp; There were many heads damaged, eyes draped in mourning,
noses fractured and legs lamed&mdash;it is a wonder that no one was
killed outright.</p>
<p>Washington was confined to his house for several weeks, but he
recovered at last.&nbsp; For a time there was a coolness between
himself and Cornwallis, but they finally concluded to join the
whole county in laughing about the surrender.</p>
<p>They live now.&nbsp; Time, the "artist," has thoroughly
whitewashed their heads, but they are very jolly still.&nbsp; On
town meeting days the old 'Squire always rides down to the
village.&nbsp; In the hind part of his venerable yellow wagon is
always a bunch of hay, ostensibly for the old white horse, but
really to hide a glass bottle from the vulgar gaze.&nbsp; This
bottle has on one side a likeness of Lafayette, and upon the other
may be seen the Goddess of Liberty.&nbsp; What the bottle contains
inside I cannot positively say, but it is true that 'Squire Wood
and Lawyer Jones visit that bottle very frequently on town-meeting
days and come back looking quite red in the face.&nbsp; When this
redness in the face becomes of the blazing kind, as it generally
does by the time the polls close, a short dialogue like this may be
heard.</p>
<p>"We shall never play surrender again, Lawyer Jones."</p>
<p>"Them days is over, 'Squire Wood!"</p>
<p>And they laugh and jocustly punch each other in the ribs.</p>

<br />
<p>The stoodent and connyseer must have noticed and admired in
varis parts of the United States of America large yeller hanbills,
which not only air gems of art in theirselves, but they troothfully
sit forth the attractions of my show&mdash;a show, let me here
obsarve, that contains many livin' wild animils, every one of which
has got a Beautiful Moral.</p>
<p>Them hanbills is sculpt in New York.</p>
<p>&amp; I annoolly repair here to git some more on 'um;</p>
<p>&amp;, bein' here, I tho't I'd issoo a Adress to the public on
matters and things.</p>
<p>Since last I meyandered these streets, I have bin all over the
Pacific Slopes and Utah.&nbsp; I cum back now, with my virtoo
unimpaired; but I've got to git some new clothes.</p>
<p>Many changes has taken place, even durin' my short absence,
&amp; sum on um is Sollum to contempulate.&nbsp; The house in
Varick street, where I used to Board, is bein' torn down.&nbsp;
That house, which was rendered memoriable by my livin' into it, is
"parsin' away! parsin' away!"&nbsp; But some of the timbers will be
made into canes, which will be sold to my admirers at the low price
of one dollar each.&nbsp; Thus is changes goin' on
continerly.&nbsp; In the New World it is war&mdash;in the Old World
Empires is totterin' &amp; Dysentaries is crumblin'.&nbsp; These
canes is cheap at a dollar.</p>
<p>Sammy Booth, Duane street, sculps my hanbills, &amp; he's
artist.&nbsp; He studid in Rome&mdash;State of New York.</p>
<p>I'm here to read the proof-sheets of my hanbils as fast as
they're sculpt.&nbsp; You have to watch these ere printers pretty
close, for they're jest as apt to spel a wurd rong as anyhow.</p>
<p>But I have time to look around sum &amp; how do I find
things?&nbsp; I return to the Atlantic States after a absence of
ten months, &amp; what State do I find the country in?&nbsp; Why I
don't know what State I find it in.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that I
do not find it in the State of New Jersey.</p>
<p>There air other cheerin' signs for Ameriky.&nbsp; We don't, for
instuns, lack great Gen'rals, and we certinly don't brave
sojers&mdash;but there's one thing I wish we did lack, and that is
our present Congress.</p>
<p>I venture to say that if you sarch the earth all over with a
ten-hoss power mikriscope, you won't be able to find such another
pack of poppycock gabblers as the present Congress of the United
States of America would be able to find&mdash;find among their
constituents.</p>
<p>Gentleman of the Senit &amp; of the House, you've sot there and
draw'd your pay and made summer-complaint speeches long
enuff.&nbsp; The country at large, incloodin' the undersined, is
disgusted with you.&nbsp; Why don't you show us a
statesman&mdash;sumbody who can make a speech that will hit the
pop'lar hart right under the great Public weskit?&nbsp; Why don't
you show us a statesman who can rise up to the Emergency, and cave
in the Emergency's head?</p>
<p>Congress, you won't do.&nbsp; Go home, you mizzerable
devils&mdash;go home!</p>
<p>At a special Congressional 'lection in my district the other day
I delib'ritly voted for Henry Clay.&nbsp; I admit that Henry is
dead, but inasmuch as we don't seem to have a live statesman in our
National Congress, let us by all means have a first-class
corpse.</p>
<p>Them who think that a cane made from the timbers of the house I
once boarded in is essenshall to their happiness, should not delay
about sendin' the money right on for one.</p>
<p>My reported captur by the North American savijis of Utah, led my
wide circle of friends and creditors to think that I had bid adoo
to earthly things and was a angel playin' on a golden harp.&nbsp;
Hents my rival home was on expected.</p>
<p>It was 11, P.M., when I reached my homestid and knockt a healthy
knock on the door thereof.</p>
<p>A nightcap thrusted itself out of the front chamber
winder.&nbsp; (It was my Betsy's nightcap.)&nbsp; And a voice
said:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It is a Man!" I answered, in a gruff vois.</p>
<p>"I don't b'lieve it!" she sed.</p>
<p>"Then come down and search me," I replied.</p>
<p>Then resumin' my nat'ral voice, I said, "It is your own A. W.,
Betsy!&nbsp; Sweet lady, wake!&nbsp; Ever of thou!"</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, "it's you, is it?&nbsp; I thought I smelt
something."</p>
<p>But the old girl was glad to see me.</p>
<p>In the mornin' I found that my family were entertainin' a artist
from Philadelphy, who was there paintin' some startlin water-falls
and mountains, and I morin suspected he had a hankerin' for my
oldest dauter.</p>
<p>"Mr. Skimmerhorn, father," sed my dauter.</p>
<p>"Glad to see you, Sir!" I replied in a hospittle vois.&nbsp;
"Glad to see you."</p>
<p>"He is an artist, father," sed my child.</p>
<p>"A whichist?"</p>
<p>"An artist.&nbsp; A painter."</p>
<p>"And glazier," I askt.&nbsp; "Air you a painter and glazier,
sir?"</p>
<p>My dauter and wife was mad, but I couldn't help it; I felt in a
comikil mood.</p>
<p>"It is a wonder to me, Sir," sed the artist, "considerin what a
widespread reputation you have, that some of our Eastern managers
don't secure you."</p>
<p>"It's a wonder to me," said I to my wife, "that somebody don't
secure him with a chain."</p>
<p>After breakfast I went over to town to see my old friends.&nbsp;
The editor of the <i>Bugle</i> greeted me cordyully, and showed me
the follerin' article he'd just written about the paper on the
other side of the street:</p>
<p>"We have recently put up in our office an entirely new sink, of
unique construction&mdash;with two holes through which the soiled
water may pass to the new bucket underneath.&nbsp; What will the
hell-hounds of "The Advertiser" say to this!&nbsp; We shall
continue to make improvements as fast as our rapidly increasing
business may warrant.&nbsp; Wonder whether a certain editor's wife
thinks she can palm off a brass watch-chain on this community for a
gold one?"</p>
<p>"That," says the Editor, "hits him whar he lives.&nbsp; That
will close him up as bad as it did when I wrote an article
ridicooling his sister, who's got a cock-eye."</p>
<p>A few days after my return I was shown a young man, who says
he'll be Dam if he goes to the war.&nbsp; He was settin' on a
barrel, and was indeed a Loathsum objeck.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I heard Parson Batkins preach, and the good old man
preached well, too, tho' his prayer was ruther lengthy.&nbsp; The
Editor of the <i>Bugle,</i> who was with me, sed that prayer would
make fifteen squares, solid nonparil.</p>
<p>I don't think of nothin' more to write about.&nbsp; So, "B'leeve
me if all those endearing young charms," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

him review some volunteers at Montreal.&nbsp; He was accompanied by
some other lords and dukes and generals and those sort of
things.&nbsp; He rode a little bay horse, and his close wasn't any
better than mine.&nbsp; You'll always notiss, by the way, that the
higher up in the world a man is, the less good harness he puts
on.&nbsp; Hence Gin'ral HALLECK walks the streets in plain
citizen's dress, while the second lieutenant of a volunteer
regiment piles all the brass things he can find onto his back, and
drags a forty-pound sword after him.</p>
<p>Monk has been in the lord bisniss some time, and I understand it
pays, tho' I don't know what a lord's wages is.</p>
<p>The wages of sin is death and postage stamps.&nbsp; But this has
nothing to do with MONK.</p>
<p>One of Lord MONK'S daughters rode with him on the field.&nbsp;
She has golden hair, a kind, good face, and wore a red hat.&nbsp; I
should be very happy to have her pay me and my family a visit at
Baldinsville.&nbsp; Come and bring your knittin', Miss MONK.&nbsp;
Mrs. WARD will do the fair thing by you.&nbsp; She makes the best
slap-jacks in America.&nbsp; As a slap-jackist, she has no
ekal.&nbsp; She wears the Belt.</p>
<p>What the review was all about, I don't know.&nbsp; I haven't a
gigantic intelleck, which can grasp great questions at onct.&nbsp;
I am not a WEBSTER or a SEYMOUR.&nbsp; I am not a WASHINGTON or a
OLD ABE.&nbsp; Fur from it.&nbsp; I am not as gifted a man as HENRY
WARD BEECHER.&nbsp; Even the congregation of Plymouth Meetin'-House
in Brooklyn will admit that.&nbsp; Yes, I should think so.&nbsp;
But while I don't have the slitest idee as to what the review was
fur, I will state that the sojers looked pooty scrumptious in their
red and green close.</p>
<p>Come with me, jentle reader, to Quebeck.&nbsp; Quebeck was
surveyed and laid out by a gentleman who had been afflicted with
the delirium tremens from childhood, and hence his idees of things
was a little irreg'ler.&nbsp; The streets don't lead anywheres in
partic'ler, but everywheres in gin'ral.&nbsp; The city is bilt on a
variety of perpendicler hills, each hill bein' a trifle wuss nor
t'other one.&nbsp; Quebeck is full of stone walls, and arches, and
citadels and things.&nbsp; It is said no foe could ever git into
Quebeck, and I guess they couldn't.&nbsp; And I don't see what
they'd <i>want</i> to get in there for.</p>
<p>Quebeck has seen lively times in a warlike way.&nbsp; The French
and Britishers had a set-to there in 1759.&nbsp; JIM WOLFE
commanded the latters, and JO. MONTCALM the formers.&nbsp; Both
were hunky boys, and fit nobly.&nbsp; But WOLFE was too many
measles for MONTCALM, and the French was slew'd.&nbsp; WOLFE and
MONTCALM was both killed.&nbsp; In arter years a common monyment
was erected by the gen'rous people of Quebeck, aided by a bully
Earl named GEORGE DALHOUSIE, to these noble fellows.&nbsp; That was
well done.</p>
<p>Durin' the Revolutionary War B. ARNOLD made his way, through
dense woods and thick snows, from Maine to Quebeck, which it was
one of the hunkiest things ever done in the military line.&nbsp; It
would have been better if B. ARNOLD'S funeral had come off
immeditly on his arrival there.</p>
<p>On the Plains of Abraham there was onct some tall fitin', and
ever since then there has been a great demand for the bones of the
slew'd on that there occasion.&nbsp; But the real ginooine bones
was long ago carried off, and now the boys make a hansum thing by
cartin' the bones of hosses and sheep out there, and sellin' 'em to
intelligent American towerists.&nbsp; Takin' a perfessional view of
this dodge, I must say that it betrays genius of a lorfty
character.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a inspired feet of my own.&nbsp; I used to
exhibit a wax figger of HENRY WILKINS, the Boy Murderer.&nbsp;
HENRY had, in a moment of inadvertence, killed his Uncle EPHRAM and
walked off with the old man's money.&nbsp; Well, this stattoo was
lost somehow, and not sposin' it would make any particler
difference I substitooted the full-grown stattoo of one of my
distinguished piruts for the Boy Murderer.&nbsp; One night I
exhibited to a poor but honest audience in the town of Stoneham,
Maine.&nbsp; "This, ladies and gentlemen," said I, pointing my
umbrella (that weapon which is indispensable to every troo
American) to the stattoo, "this is a life-like wax figger of the
notorious HENRY WILKINS, who in the dead of night murdered his
Uncle EPHRAM in cold blood.&nbsp; A sad warning to all uncles
havin' murderers for nephews.&nbsp; When a mere child this HENRY
WILKINS was compelled to go to the Sunday-school.&nbsp; He carried
no Sunday-school book.&nbsp; The teacher told him to go home and
bring one.&nbsp; He went and returned with a comic song-book.&nbsp;
A depraved proceedin'."</p>
<p>"But," says a man in the audience, "when you was here before
your wax figger represented HENRY WILKINS as a boy.&nbsp; Now,
HENRY was hung, and yet you show him to us now as a full-grown
man!&nbsp; How's that?"</p>
<p>"The figger has growd, sir&mdash;it has growd," I said.</p>
<p>I was angry.&nbsp; If it had been in these times I think I
should have informed agin him as a traitor to his flag, and had him
put in Fort Lafayette.</p>
<p>I say adoo to Quebeck with regret.&nbsp; It is old-fogyish, but
chock-full of interest.&nbsp; Young gentlemen of a romantic turn of
mind, who air botherin' their heads as to how they can spend their
father's money, had better see Quebeck.</p>
<p>Altogether I like Canady.&nbsp; Good people and lots of pretty
girls.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind comin' over here to live in the
capacity of a Duke, provided a vacancy occurs, and provided further
I could be allowed a few tar-spangled banners, a eagle, a boon of
liberty, etc.</p>
<p>Don't think I've skedaddled.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; I'm coming
home in a week.</p>
<p>Let's have the Union restored as it was, if we can; <i>but if we
can't, I'm in favor of the Union as it wasn't</i> .&nbsp; But the
Union, anyhow.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the editorial corpse, if you would be happy be
virtoous!&nbsp; I who am the emblem of virtoo, tell you so.</p>

</center>
<br />
<p>The red man of the forest was form'ly a very respectful
person.&nbsp; Justice to the noble aboorygine warrants me in sayin'
that orrigernerly he was a majestic cuss.</p>
<p>At the time CHRIS. arrove on these shores (I allood to CHRIS.
COLUMBUS), the savajis was virtoous and happy.&nbsp; They were
innocent of secession, rum, draw-poker, and sinfulness
gin'rally.&nbsp; They didn't discuss the slavery question as a
custom.&nbsp; They had no Congress, faro banks, delirium tremens,
or Associated Press.&nbsp; Their habits was consequently
good.&nbsp; Late suppers, dyspepsy, gas companies, thieves, ward
politicians, pretty waiter-girls, and other metropolitan
refinements, were unknown among them.&nbsp; No savage in good
standing would take postage-stamps.&nbsp; You couldn't have bo't a
coonskin with a barrel of 'em.&nbsp; The female Aboorygine never
died of consumption, because she didn't tie her waist up in
whale-bone things; but in loose and flowin' garments she bounded,
with naked feet, over hills and plains, like the wild and frisky
antelope.&nbsp; It was a onlucky moment for us when CHRIS. sot his
foot onto these 'ere shores.&nbsp; It would have been better for us
of the present day if the injins had given him a warm meal and sent
him home ore the ragin' billers.&nbsp; For the savages owned the
country, and COLUMBUS was a fillibuster.&nbsp; CORTEZ, PIZARRO, and
WALKER were one-horse fillibusters&mdash;COLUMBUS was a four-horse
team fillibuster, and a large yaller dog under the waggin.&nbsp; I
say, in view of the mess we are makin' of things, it would have
been better for us if cOLUMBUS had staid to home.&nbsp; It would
have been better for the show bisniss.&nbsp; The circulation of
"Vanity Fair" would be larger, and the proprietors would all have
boozum pins!&nbsp; Yes, sir, and perhaps a ten-pin alley.</p>
<p>By which I don't wish to be understood as intimatin' that the
scalpin' wretches who are in the injin bisness at the present day
are of any account, or calculated to make home happy, specially the
Sioxes of Minnesoty, who desarve to be murdered in the first
degree, and if POPE will only stay in St. Paul and not go near 'em
HIMSELF, I reckon they will be.</p>

<p>OLONZO WARD.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Afore I comments this letter from the late rebil capitol I
desire to cimply say that I hav seen a low and skurrilus noat in
the paper from a certin purson who singes hisself Olonzo Ward,
&amp; sez he is my berruther.&nbsp; I did <i>once</i> hav a
berruther of that name, but I do not recugnize him now.&nbsp; To me
he is wuss than ded!&nbsp; I took him from collige sum 16 years ago
and gave him a good situation as the Bearded Woman in my
Show.&nbsp; How did he repay me for this kindness?&nbsp; He basely
undertook (one day while in a Backynalian mood on rum &amp; right
in sight of the aujience in the tent) to stand upon his hed,
whareby he betray'd his sex on account of his boots &amp; his Beard
fallin' off his face, thus rooinin' my prospecks in that town,
&amp; likewise incurrin' the seris displeasure of the Press, which
sed boldly I was triflin with the feelin's of a intelligent
public.&nbsp; I know no such man as Olonzo Ward.&nbsp; I do not
even wish his name breathed in my presents.&nbsp; I do not
recognize him.&nbsp; I perfectly disgust him.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>RICHMOND.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The old man finds hisself once more in a Sunny climb.&nbsp; I
cum here a few days arter the city catterpillertulated.</p>
<p>My naburs seemed surprised &amp; astonisht at this darin'
bravery onto the part of a man at my time of life, but our family
was never know'd to quale in danger's stormy hour.</p>
<p>My father was a sutler in the Revolootion War.&nbsp; My father
once had a intervoo with Gin'ral La Fayette.</p>
<p>He asked La Fayette to lend him five dollars, promisin' to pay
him in the Fall; but Lafy said "he couldn't see it in those
lamps."&nbsp; Lafy was French, and his knowledge of our langwidge
was a little shaky.</p>
<p>Immejutly on my 'rival here I perceeded to the Spotswood House,
and callin' to my assistans a young man from our town who writes a
good runnin' hand, I put my ortograph on the Register, and handin'
my umbrella to a baldheded man behind the counter, who I s'posed
was Mr. Spotswood, I said, "Spotsy, how does she run?"</p>
<p>He called a cullud purson, and said,</p>
<p>"Show the gen'lman to the cowyard, and giv' him cart number
1."</p>
<p>"Isn't Grant here?" I said.&nbsp; "Perhaps Ulyssis wouldn't mind
my turnin' in with him."</p>
<p>"Do you know the Gin'ral?" inquired Mr. Spotswood.</p>
<p>"Wall, no, not 'zacky; but he'll remember me.&nbsp; His
brother-in-law's Aunt bought her rye meal of my uncle Levi all one
winter.&nbsp; My uncle Levi's rye meal was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said Spotsy, "don't bother me," and he shuv'd my
umbrella onto the floor.&nbsp; Obsravin' to him not to be so
keerless with that wepin, I accompanid the African to my
lodgins.</p>
<p>"My brother," I sed, "air you aware that you've bin
mancipated?&nbsp; Do you realize how glorus it is to be free?&nbsp;
Tell me, my dear brother, does it not seem like some dreams, or do
you realize the great fact in all its livin' and holy
magnitood?"</p>
<p>He sed he would take some gin.</p>
<p>I was show'd to the cowyard and laid down under a one-mule
cart.&nbsp; The hotel was orful crowded, and I was sorry I hadn't
gone to the Libby Prison.&nbsp; Tho' I should hav' slept comf'ble
enuff if the bed-clothes hadn't bin pulled off me durin' the night,
by a scoundrul who cum and hitched a mule to the cart and druv it
off.&nbsp; I thus lost my cuverin', and my throat feels a little
husky this mornin'.</p>
<p>Gin'ral Hulleck offers me the hospitality of the city, givin me
my choice of hospitals.</p>
<p>He has also very kindly placed at my disposal a smallpox
amboolance.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>UNION SENTIMENT.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>There is raly a great deal of Union sentiment in this
city.&nbsp; I see it on ev'ry hand.</p>
<p>I met a man to-day&mdash;I am not at liberty to tell his name,
but he is a old and inflooentooial citizen of Richmond, and sez he,
"Why!&nbsp; We've bin fightin' agin the Old Flag!&nbsp; Lor' bless
me, how sing'lar!"&nbsp; He then borrer'd five dollars of me and
bust into a flood of teers.</p>
<p>Sed another (a man of standin' and formerly a bitter rebuel),
"Let us at once stop this effooshun of Blud!&nbsp; The Old Flag is
good enuff for me.&nbsp; Sir," he added, "you air from the
North!&nbsp; Have you a doughnut or a piece of custard pie about
you?"</p>
<p>I told him no, but I knew a man from Vermont who had just
organized a sort of restaurant, where he could go and make a very
comfortable breakfast on New England rum and cheese.&nbsp; He
borrowed fifty cents of me, and askin' me to send him Wm. Lloyd
Garrison's ambrotype as soon as I got home, he walked off.</p>
<p>Said another, "There's bin a tremendous Union feelin here from
the fust.&nbsp; But we was kept down by a rain of terror.&nbsp;
Have you a dagerretype of Wendell Phillips about your person? and
will you lend me four dollars for a few days till we air once more
a happy and united people."</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>JEFF. DAVIS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Jeff. Davis is not pop'lar here.&nbsp; She is regarded as a
Southern sympathizer.&nbsp; &amp; yit I'm told he was kind to his
Parents.&nbsp; She ran away from 'em many years ago, and has never
bin back.&nbsp; This was showin' 'em a good deal of consideration
when we refleck what his conduck has been.&nbsp; Her captur in
female apparel confooses me in regard to his sex, &amp; you see I
speak of him as a her as frekent as otherwise, &amp; I guess he
feels so hisself.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>R. LEE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Robert Lee is regarded as a noble feller.</p>
<p>He was opposed to the war at the fust, and draw'd his sword very
reluctant.&nbsp; In fact, he wouldn't hav' drawd his sword at all,
only he had a large stock of military clothes on hand, which he
didn't want to waste.&nbsp; He sez the colored man is right, and he
will at once go to New York and open a Sabbath School for negro
minstrels.</p>
<br />
<p>THE CONFEDERATE ARMY.</p>
<br />
<p>The surrender of R. Lee, J. Johnston and others leaves the
Confedrit Army in a ruther shattered state.&nbsp; That army now
consists of Kirby Smith, four mules and a Bass drum, and is movin'
rapidly to'rds Texis.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>A PROUD AND HAWTY SUTHENER.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Feelin' a little peckish, I went into a eatin' house to-day and
encountered a young man with long black hair and slender
frame.&nbsp; He didn't wear much clothes, and them as he did wear
looked onhealthy.&nbsp; He frowned on me, and sed, kinder scornful,
"So, Sir&mdash;you come here to taunt us in our hour of trouble, do
you?"</p>
<p>"No," said I, "I cum here for hash!"</p>
<p>"Pish-haw!" he sed sneerinly, "I mean you air in this city for
the purposes of gloating over a fallen people.&nbsp; Others may
basely succumb, but as for me, I will never yield&mdash;NEVER,
NEVER!"</p>
<p>"Hav' suthin' to eat!" I pleasantly suggested.</p>
<p>"Tripe and onions!" he sed furcely; then he added, "I eat with
you, but I hate you.&nbsp; You're a low-lived Yankee!"</p>
<p>To which I pleasantly replied, "How'l you have your tripe?"</p>
<p>"Fried, mudsill! with plenty of ham-fat!"</p>
<p>He et very ravenus.&nbsp; Poor feller!&nbsp; He had lived on
odds and ends for several days, eatin' crackers that had bin turned
over by revelers in the bread tray at the bar.</p>
<p>He got full at last, and his hart softened a little to'ards
me.&nbsp; "After all," he sed, "you have sum people at the North
who air not wholly loathsum beasts?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes," I sed, "we hav' now and then a man among us who
isn't a cold-bluded scoundril.&nbsp; Young man," I mildly but
gravely sed, "this crooil war is over, and you're lickt!&nbsp; It's
rather necessary for sumbody to lick in a good square, lively fite,
and in this 'ere case it happens to be the United States of
America.&nbsp; You fit splendid, but we was too many for you.&nbsp;
Then make the best of it, &amp; let us all give in and put the
Republic on a firmer basis nor ever.</p>
<p>"I don't gloat over your misfortuns, my young fren'.&nbsp; Fur
from it.&nbsp; I'm a old man now, &amp; my hart is softer nor it
once was.&nbsp; You see my spectacles is misten'd with suthin' very
like tears.&nbsp; I'm thinkin' of the sea of good rich Blud that
has been spilt on both sides in this dredful war!&nbsp; I'm
thinkin' of our widders and orfuns North, and of your'n in the
South.&nbsp; I kin cry for both.&nbsp; B'leeve me, my young fren',
I kin place my old hands tenderly on the fair yung hed of the
Virginny maid whose lover was laid low in the battle dust by a
fed'ral bullet, and say, as fervently and piously as a vener'ble
sinner like me kin say anythin', God be good to you, my poor dear,
my poor dear."</p>
<p>I riz up to go, &amp; takin' my young Southern fren' kindly by
the hand, I sed, "Yung man, adoo!&nbsp; You Southern fellers is
probly my brothers, tho' you've occasionally had a cussed queer way
of showin' it!&nbsp; It's over now.&nbsp; Let us all line in and
make a country on this continent that shall giv' all Europe the
cramp in the stummuck ev'ry time they look at us!&nbsp; Adoo,
adoo!"</p>
<p>And as I am through, I likewise say adoo to you, jentle reader,
merely remarkin' that the Star-Spangled Banner is wavin' round
loose agin, and that there don't seem to be anything the matter
with the Goddess of Liberty beyond a slite cold.</p>

</center>
<br />
<p>FRIEND WALES,&mdash;You remember me.&nbsp; I saw you in Canady a
few years ago.&nbsp; I remember you too.&nbsp; I seldim forget a
person.</p>
<p>I hearn of your marriage to the Printcis Alexandry, &amp; ment
ter writ you a congratoolatory letter at the time, but I've bin
bildin a barn this summer, &amp; hain't had no time to write
letters to folks.&nbsp; Excoose me.</p>
<p>Numeris changes has tooken place since we met in the body
politic.&nbsp; The body politic, in fack, is sick.&nbsp; I
sometimes think it has got biles, friend Wales.</p>
<p>In my country we've got war, while your country, in conjunktion
with Cap'n Sems of the "Alobarmy," manetanes a nootral
position!</p>
<p>I'm afraid I can't write goaks when I sit about it.&nbsp; Oh no,
I guess not!</p>
<p>Yes, Sir, we've got a war, and the troo Patrit has to make
sacrifisses, you bet.</p>
<p>I have alreddy given two cousins to the war, &amp; I stand reddy
to sacrifiss my wife's brother ruther'n not see the rebelyin
krusht.&nbsp; And if wuss cums to wuss I'll shed ev'ry drop of blud
my able-bodied relations has got to prosekoot the war.&nbsp; I
think sumbody oughter be prosekooted, &amp; it may as well be the
war as any body else.&nbsp; When I git a goakin fit onto me it's no
use to try ter stop me.</p>
<p>You hearn about the draft, friend Wales, no doubt.&nbsp; It
caused sum squirmin', but it was fairly conducted, I think, for it
hit all classes.&nbsp; It is troo that Wendill Phillips, who is a
American citizen of African scent, 'scaped, but so did
Vallandiggum, who is Conservativ, and who wus resuntly sent South,
tho' he would have bin sent to the Dry Tortoogus if Abe had 'sposed
for a minit that the Tortoogusses would keep him.</p>
<p>We hain't got any daily paper in our town, but we've got a
female sewin' circle, which ansers the same purpuss, and we wasn't
long in suspents as to who was drafted.</p>
<p>One young man who was drawd claimed to be exemp because he was
the only son of a widow'd mother who supported him.&nbsp; A few
able-bodid dead men was drafted, but whether their heirs will have
to pay 3 hundrid dollars a peace for 'em is a question for Whitin',
who 'pears to be tinkerin' up this draft bizniss right smart.&nbsp;
I hope he makes good wages.</p>
<p>I think most of the conscrips in this place will go.&nbsp; A few
will go to Canady, stopping on their way at Concord, N.H., where I
understan there is a Muslum of Harts.</p>
<p>You see I'm sassy, friend Wales, hittin' all sides; but no
offense is ment.&nbsp; You know I ain't a politician, and never
was.&nbsp; I vote for Mr. Union&mdash;that's the only candidate
I've got.&nbsp; I claim, howsever, to have a well-balanced mind;
tho' my idees of a well-balanced mind differs from the idees of a
partner I once had, whose name it was Billson.&nbsp; Billson and me
orjanized a strollin' dramatic company, &amp; we played The
Drunkard, or the Falling Saved, with a real drunkard.&nbsp; The
play didn't take particlarly, and says Billson to me, Let's giv 'em
some immoral dramy.&nbsp; We had a large troop onto our hands,
consisting of eight tragedians and a bass drum, but I says, No,
Billson; and then says I, Billson, you hain't got a well-balanced
mind.&nbsp; Says he, Yes, I have, old hoss-fly (he was a low
cuss)&mdash;yes, I have.&nbsp; I have a mind, says he, that
balances in any direction that the public rekires.&nbsp; That's wot
I call a well-balanced mind.&nbsp; I sold out and bid adoo to
Billson.&nbsp; He is now an outcast in the State of
Vermont.&nbsp;<img align="left" src="images/15.gif" alt=
"picture of a man playing a flute" /> The miser'ble man once played
Hamlet.&nbsp; There wasn't any orchestry, and wishin' to expire to
slow moosic, he died playin' on a claironett himself, interspersed
with hart-rendin' groans, &amp; such is the world!&nbsp; Alars!
alars! how onthankful we air to that Providence which kindly allows
us to live and borrow money, and fail und do bizniss!</p>
<p>But to return to our subjeck.&nbsp; With our resunt grate
triumps on the Mississippi, the Father of Waters (and them is
waters no Father need feel 'shamed of&mdash;twig the wittikism?)
and the cheerin' look of things in other places, I reckon we shan't
want any Muslum of Harts.&nbsp; And what upon airth do the people
of Concord, N.H., want a Muslum of Harts for?&nbsp; Hain't you got
the State House now? &amp; what more do you want?</p>
<p>But all this is furrin to the purpuss of this note, arter
all.&nbsp; My objeck in now addressin' you is to giv you sum
advice, friend Wales, about managin' your wife, a bizniss I've had
over thirty years experience in.</p>
<p>You had a good weddin.&nbsp; The papers have a good deal to say
about "vikins" in connexion thare with.&nbsp; Not knowings what
that air, and so I frankly tells you, my noble lord dook of the
throne, I can't zackly say whether we hab 'em or not.&nbsp; We was
both very much flustrated.&nbsp; But I never injoyed myself better
in my life.</p>
<p>Dowtless, your supper was ahead of our'n.&nbsp; As regards
eatin' uses, Baldinsville was allers shaky.&nbsp; But you can git a
good meal in New York, &amp; cheap to.&nbsp; You can git half a
mackril at Delmonico's or Mr. Mason Dory's for six dollars, and
biled pertaters throw'd in.</p>
<p>As I sed, I manige my wife without any particler trouble.&nbsp;
When I fust commenst trainin' her I institooted a series of
experiments, and them as didn't work I abanding'd.&nbsp; You'd
better do similer.&nbsp; Your wife may objeck to gittin' up and
bildin' the fire in the mornin', but if you commence with her at
once you may be able to overkum this prejoodiss.&nbsp; I regret to
obsarve that I didn't commence arly enuff.&nbsp; I wouldn't have
you s'pose I was ever kicked out of bed.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; I
simply say, in regard to bildin' fires, that, I didn't commence
arly enuff.&nbsp; It was a ruther cold mornin' when I fust proposed
the idee to Betsy.&nbsp; It wasn't well received, and I found
myself layin' on the floor putty suddent.&nbsp; I thought I'd git
up and bild the fire myself.</p>
<p>Of course now you're marrid you can eat onions.&nbsp; <i>I</i>
allus did, and if I know my own hart, I allus will.&nbsp; My
daughter, who is goin' on 17 and is frisky, says they's
disgustin.&nbsp; And speaking of my daughter reminds me that quite
a number of young men have suddenly discovered that I'm a very
entertainin' old feller, and they visit us frekently, specially on
Sunday evenins.&nbsp; One young chap&mdash;a lawyer by
habit&mdash;don't cum as much as he did.&nbsp; My wife's father
lives with us.&nbsp; His intelleck totters a little, and he saves
the papers containin' the proceedins of our State Legislater.&nbsp;
The old gen'l'man likes to read out loud, and he reads tol'ble
well.&nbsp; He eats hash freely, which makes his voice clear; but
as he onfortnitly has to spell the most of his words, I may say he
reads slow.&nbsp; Wall, whenever this lawyer made his appearance I
would set the old man a-reading the Legislativ' reports.&nbsp; I
kept the young lawyer up one night till 12 o'clock listenin to a
lot of acts in regard to a drawbridge away orf in the east part of
the State, havin' sent my daughter to bed at half-past 8.&nbsp; He
hasn't bin there since, and I understan' he says I go round
swindlin' the Public.</p>
<p>I never attempted to reorganize my wife but onct.&nbsp; I shall
never attempt agin.&nbsp; I'd bin to a public dinner, and had
allowed myself to be betrayed into drinkin' several people's
healths; and wishin' to make 'em as robust as possible, I
continnerd drinkin' their healths until my own became
affected.&nbsp; Consekens was, I presented myself at Betsy's
bedside late at night with consid'ble licker concealed about my
person.&nbsp; I had sumhow got perseshun of a hosswhip on my way
home, and rememberin' sum cranky observations of Mrs. Ward's in the
mornin', I snapt the whip putty lively, and in a very loud woice, I
sed, "Betsy, you need reorganizin'!&nbsp; I have cum, Betsy," I
continued&mdash;crackin the whip over the bed&mdash;"I have cum to
reorganize you! Haave you per-ayed tonight?"</p>

<p>I dream'd that sumbody had laid a hosswhip over me sev'ril
conseckootiv times; and when I woke up I found she had.&nbsp; I
hain't drank much of anythin' since, and if I ever have another
reorganizin' job on hand I shall let it out.</p>
<p>My wife is 52 years old, and has allus sustained a good
character.&nbsp; She's a good cook.&nbsp; Her mother lived to a
vener'ble age, and died while in the act of frying slapjacks for
the County Commissioners.&nbsp; And may no rood hand pluk a flour
from her toomstun!&nbsp; We hain't got any picter of the old lady,
because she'd never stand for her ambrotipe, and therefore I can't
giv her likeness to the world through the meejum of the
illusterated papers; but as she wasn't a brigadier-gin'ral,
particlerly, I don't s'pose they'd publish it, any how.</p>
<p>It's best to give a woman considerable lee-way.&nbsp; But not
too much.&nbsp; A naber of mine, Mr. Roofus Minkins, was once very
sick with the fever, but his wife moved his bed into the door-yard
while she was cleanin' house.&nbsp; I toald Roofus this wasn't the
thing, 'specially as it was rainin' vi'lently; but he said he
wanted to giv his wife "a little lee-way."&nbsp; That was 2
mutch.&nbsp; I told Mrs. Minkins that her Roofus would die if he
staid out there into the rain much longer; when she said, "It
shan't be my fault if he dies unprepared," at the same time tossin'
him his mother's Bible.&nbsp; It was orful!&nbsp; I stood by,
however, and nussed him as well's I could, but I was a putty
wet-nuss, I tell you.</p>
<p>There's varis ways of managin' a wife, friend Wales, but the
best and only safe way is to let her do jist about as she wants
to.&nbsp; I 'dopted that there plan sum time ago, and it works like
a charm.</p>
<p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. Wales, and good luck to you
both!&nbsp; And as years roll by, and accidents begin to happen to
you&mdash;among which I hope there'll be Twins&mdash;you will agree
with me that family joys air the only ones a man can bet on with
any certinty of winnin'.</p>
<p>It may interest you to know that I'm prosperin' in a pecoonery

<p>CHAPTER I.&mdash;ELIZY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>My story opens in the classic presinks of Bostin.&nbsp; In the
parler of a bloated aristocratic mansion on Bacon street sits a
luvly young lady, whose hair is cuvered ore with the frosts of
between 17 Summers.&nbsp; She has just sot down to the piany, and
is warblin the popler ballad called "Smells of the Notion," in
which she tells how, with pensiv thought, she wandered by a C beat
shore.&nbsp; The son is settin in its horizon, and its gorjus light
pores in a golden meller flud through the winders, and makes the
young lady twict as beautiful nor what she was before, which is
onnecessary.&nbsp; She is magnificently dressed up in a Berage
basque, with poplin trimmins, More Antique, Ball Morals and 3 ply
carpeting.&nbsp; Also, considerable gauze.&nbsp; Her dress contains
16 flounders and her shoes is red morocker, with gold spangles onto
them.&nbsp; Presently she jumps up with a wild snort, and pressin
her hands to her brow, she exclaims: "Methinks I see a voice!"</p>
<p>A noble youth of 27 summers enters.&nbsp; He is attired in a red
shirt and black trowsis, which last air turned up over his boots;
his hat, which it is a plug, being cockt onto one side of his
classical hed.&nbsp; In sooth, he was a heroic lookin person, with
a fine shape.&nbsp; Grease, in its barmiest days, near projuced a
more hefty cavileer.&nbsp; Gazin upon him admiringly for a spell,
Elizy (for that was her name) organized herself into a tabloo, and
stated as follers.</p>
<p>"Ha! do me eyes deceive me earsight?&nbsp; Is it some
dreams?&nbsp; No, I reckon not!&nbsp; That frame! them store close!
those nose!&nbsp; Yes, it is me own, me only Moses!"</p>
<p>He (Moses) folded her to his hart, with the remark that he was
"a hunkey boy."</p>
<br />

<center>
<p>CHAPTER II.&mdash;WAS MOSES Of NOBLE BIRTH?</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Moses was foreman of Engine Co. No. 40.&nbsp; Forty's fellers
had just bin havin an annual reunion with Fifty's fellers, on the
day I introjuce Moses to my readers, and Moses had his arms full of
trofees, to wit: 4 scalps, 5 eyes, 3 fingers, 7 ears, (which he
chawed off) and several half and quarter sections of noses.&nbsp;
When the fair Elizy recovered from her delight at meetin Moses, she
said:&mdash;"How hast the battle gonest?&nbsp; Tell me!"</p>
<p>"We chawed 'em up&mdash;that's what we did!" said the bold
Moses.</p>
<p>"I thank the gods!" said the fair Elizy.&nbsp; "Thou did'st
excellent well.&nbsp; And, Moses," she continnered, layin her hed
confidinly agin his weskit, "dost know I sumtimes think thou istest
of noble birth?"</p>
<p>"No!" said he, wildly ketchin hold of hisself.&nbsp; "You don't
say so!"</p>
<p>"Indeed do I!&nbsp; Your dead grandfather's sperrit comest to me
the tother night."</p>
<p>"Oh no, I guess it's a mistake," said Moses.</p>
<p>"I'll bet two dollars and a quarter he did!" replied
Elizy.&nbsp; "He said, 'Moses is a Disguised Juke!'"</p>
<p>"You mean Duke," said Moses.</p>
<p>"Dost not the actors all call it Juke?" said she.</p>
<p>That settled the matter.</p>
<p>"I hav thought of this thing afore," said Moses,
abstractedly.&nbsp; "If it is so, then thus it must be!&nbsp; 2 B
or not 2 B!&nbsp; Which?&nbsp; Sow, sow!&nbsp; But enuff.&nbsp; O
life! life!&mdash;<i>you're too many for me</i>"&nbsp; He tore out
some of his pretty yeller hair, stampt on the floor sevril times,

<p>CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE PIRUT FOILED.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Sixteen long and weary years has elapst since the seens narrated
in the last chapter took place.&nbsp; A noble ship, the Sary Jane,
is a sailin from France to Ameriky via the Wabash Canal.&nbsp; A
pirut ship is in hot pursoot of the Sary.&nbsp; The pirut capting
isn't a man of much principle and intends to kill all the people on
bored the Sary and confiscate the wallerbles.&nbsp; The capting of
the S.J. is on the pint of givin in, when a fine lookin feller in
russet boots and a buffalo overcoat rushes forored and
obsarves:</p>
<p>"Old man! go down stairs!&nbsp; Retire to the starbud
bulkhed!&nbsp; I'll take charge of this Bote!"</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/16.gif" alt=
"picture of stranger holding up Captain's head." />"Owdashus cuss!"
yelled the capting, "away with thee or I shall do
mur-rer-der-r-r!"</p>
<p>"Skurcely," obsarved the stranger, and he drew a diamond-hilted
fish-knife and cut orf the capting's hed.&nbsp; He expired shortly,
his last words bein, "we are governed too much."</p>
<p>"People!" sed the stranger, "I'm the Juke d'Moses!"</p>
<p>"Old hoss!" sed a passenger, "methinks thou art blowin!"
whareupon the Juke cut orf his hed also.</p>
<p>"Oh that I should live to see myself a dead body!" screamed the
unfortnit man.&nbsp; "But don't print any verses about my deth in
the newspapers, for if you do I'll haunt ye!"</p>
<p>"People!" sed the Juke, "I alone can save you from yon bloody
pirut!&nbsp; Ho! a peck of oats!"&nbsp; The oats was brought, and
the Juke, boldly mountin the jibpoop, throwed them onto the
towpath.&nbsp; The pirut rapidly approached, chucklin with fiendish
delight at the idee of increasin his ill-gotten gains.&nbsp; But
the leadin hoss of the pirut ship stopt suddent on comin to the
oats, and commenst for to devour them.&nbsp; In vain the piruts
swore and throwd stones and bottles at the hoss&mdash;he wouldn't
budge a inch.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Sary Jane, her hosses on the full
jump, was fast leavin the pirut ship!</p>
<p>"Onct agin do I escape deth!" sed the Juke between his clencht
teeth, still on the jibpoop.</p>

<center>
<p>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The Juke was Moses the Sassy!&nbsp; Yes, it was!</p>
<p>He had bin to France and now he was home agin in Bostin, which
gave birth to a Bunker Hill!!&nbsp; He had some trouble in gitting
hisself acknowledged as Juke in France, as the Orleans Dienasty and
Borebones were fernest him, but he finally conkered.&nbsp; Elizy
knowd him right off, as one of his ears and a part of his nose had
bin chawed off in his fights with opposition firemen during
boyhood's sunny hours.&nbsp; They lived to a green old age, beloved
by all, both grate and small.&nbsp; Their children, of which they
have numerous, often go up onto the Common and see the Fountain
squirt.</p>
<p>This is my 1st attempt at writin a Tail &amp; it is far from
bein perfeck, but if I have indoosed folks to see that in 9 cases
out of 10 they can either make life as barren as the Desert of
Sarah, or as joyyus as a flower garding, my object will have been
accomplished, and more too.</p>

<p>On the sad sea shore!&nbsp; Always to hear the moaning of these
dismal waves!</p>
<p>Listen.&nbsp; I will tell you my story&mdash;my story of love,
of misery, of black despair.</p>
<p>I am a moral Frenchman.</p>
<p>She whom I adore, whom I adore still, is the wife of a fat
Marquis&mdash;a lop-eared, blear-eyed,greasy Marquis.&nbsp; A man
without soul.&nbsp; A man without sentiment, who cares naught for

<p>She, my soul's delight, my empress, my angel, is superbly
beautiful.</p>
<p>I loved her at first sight&mdash;devotedly, madly.</p>
<p>She dashed past me in her coupe.&nbsp; I saw her but a
moment&mdash;perhaps only an instant&mdash;but she took me captive
then and there, forevermore.</p>
<p>Forevermore!</p>
<p>I followed her, after that, wherever she went.&nbsp; At length
she came to notice, to smile upon me.&nbsp; My motto was en
avant!&nbsp; That is a French word.&nbsp; I got it out of the back
part of Worcester's Dictionary.</p>

<p>III.</p>
</center>

<p>She wrote me that I might come and see her at her own
house.&nbsp; Oh, joy, joy unutterable, to see her at her own
house!</p>
<p>I went to see her after nightfall, in the soft moonlight.</p>
<p>She came down the graveled walk to meet me, on this beautiful
midsummer night&mdash;came to me in pure white, her golden hair in
splendid disorder&mdash;strangely beautiful, yet in tears!</p>
<p>She told me her fresh grievances.</p>
<p>The Marquis, always a despot, had latterly misused her most
vilely.</p>
<p>That very morning, at breakfast, he had cursed the fishballs and
sneered at the pickled onions.</p>
<p>She is a good cook.&nbsp; The neighbors will tell you so.&nbsp;
And to be told by the base Marquis&mdash;a man who, previous to his
marriage, had lived at the cheap eating-houses&mdash;to be told by
him that her manner of frying fishballs was a failure&mdash;it was
too much.</p>
<p>Her tears fell fast.&nbsp; I too wept.&nbsp; I mixed my sobs
with her'n.&nbsp; "Fly with me!" I cried.</p>
<p>Her lips met mine.&nbsp; I held her in my arms.&nbsp; I felt her
breath upon my cheek!&nbsp; It was Hunkey.</p>
<p>"Fly with me.&nbsp; To New York!&nbsp; I will write romances for
the Sunday papers&mdash;real French romances, with morals to
them.&nbsp; My style will be appreciated.&nbsp; Shop girls and
young mercantile persons will adore it, and I will amass wealth
with my ready pen."</p>
<p>Ere she could reply&mdash;ere she could articulate her ecstasy,
her husband, the Marquis, crept snake-like upon me.</p>
<p>Shall I write it?&nbsp; He kicked me out of the garden&mdash;he
kicked me into the street.</p>
<p>I did not return.&nbsp; How could I?&nbsp; I, so ethereal, so
full of soul, of sentiment, of sparkling originality!&nbsp; He, so
gross, so practical, so lop-eared!</p>
<p>Had I returned, the creature would have kicked me again.</p>
<p>So I left Paris for this place&mdash;this place, so lonely, so
dismal.</p>

<br />
<p>Philander Reed struggled with spool-thread and tape in a
dry-goods store at Ogdensburg, on the St. Lawrence River, State of
New York.&nbsp; He Rallied Round the Flag, Boys, and <i>Hailed</i>
Columbia every time she passed that way.&nbsp; One day a regiment
returning from the war Came Marching Along, bringing An Intelligent
Contraband with them, who left the South about the time Babylon was
a-Fallin', and when it was apparent to all well-ordered minds that
the Kingdom was Coming, accompanied by the Day of Jubilee.&nbsp;
Philander left his spool-thread and tape, rushed into the street,
and by his Long-Tail Blue, sed, "Let me kiss him for his
Mother."&nbsp; Then, with patriotic jocularity, he inquired, "How
is your High Daddy in the Morning?" to which Pomp of Cudjo's Cave
replied, "That poor Old Slave has gone to rest, we ne'er shall see
him more!&nbsp; But U.S.G. is the man for me, or Any other
Man."&nbsp; Then he Walked Round.</p>
<p>"And your Master," sed Philander, "where is he?"</p>
<p>"Massa's in the cold, cold ground&mdash;at least I hope so!" sed
the gay contraband.</p>
<p>"March on, March on! all hearts rejoice!" cried the Colonel, who
was mounted on a Bob-tailed nag&mdash;on which, in times of Peace,
my soul, O Peace! he had betted his money.</p>
<p>"Yaw," sed a German Bold Sojer Boy, "we don't-fights-mit-Segel
as much as we did."</p>
<p>The regiment marched on, and Philander betook himself to his
mother's Cottage Near the Banks of that Lone River, and rehearsed
the stirring speech he was to make that night at a war meeting.</p>
<p>"It's just before the battle, Mother," he said, "and I want to
say something that will encourage Grant."</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.&mdash;MABEL.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Mabel Tucker was an orphan.&nbsp; Her father, Dan Tucker, was
run over one day by a train of cars though he needn't have been,
for the kind-hearted engineer told him to Git out of the Way.</p>
<p>Mabel early manifested a marked inclination for the milinery
business, and at the time we introduce her to our readers she was
Chief Engineer of a Millinery Shop and Boss of a Sewing
Machine.</p>
<p>Philander Reed loved Mabel Tucker, and Ever of her was Fondly
Dreaming; and she used to say, "Will you love me Then as Now?" to
which he would answer that he would, and <i>without</i> the written
consent of his parents.</p>
<p>She sat in the parlor of the Cot where she was Born, one
Summer's eve, with pensive thought, when Somebody came Knocking at
the Door.&nbsp; It was Philander.&nbsp; Fond Embrace and
things.&nbsp; Thrilling emotions.&nbsp; P. very pale and shaky in
the legs.&nbsp; Also, sweaty.</p>
<p>"Where hast thou been?" she sed.&nbsp; "Hast been gathering
shells from youth to age, and then leaving them like a
che-eild?&nbsp; Why this tremors?&nbsp; Why these Sadfulness?"</p>
<p>"Mabeyuel!" he cried.&nbsp; "Mabeyuel!&nbsp; They've Drafted me
into the Army!"</p>
<p>An orderly Surgeant now appears and says, "Come, Philander,
let's be a-marching;"&nbsp; And he tore her from his embrace (P.'s)
and marched the conscript to the Examining Surgeon's office.</p>
<p>Mabel fainted in two places.&nbsp; It was worse than Brother's
Fainting at the Door.</p>

<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE CONSCRIPT.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Philander Reed hadn't three hundred dollars, being a dead-broken
Reed, so he must either become one of the noble Band who are
Coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more, or skedaddle
across the St. Lawrence River to the Canada Line.&nbsp; As his
opinions had recently undergone a radical change, he chose the
latter course, and was soon Afloat, afloat, on the swift rolling
tide.&nbsp; "Row, brothers, row," he cried, "the stream runs fast,
the Sergeant is near, and the Zamination's past, and I'm a
able-bodied man."</p>
<p>Landing, he at once imprinted a conservative kiss on the Canada
Line, and feelingly asked himself, "Who will care for Mother
now?&nbsp; But I propose to stick it out on this Line if it takes
all Summer."</p>
<br />
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE MEETING.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>It was evening, <i>it</i> was.&nbsp; The Star of the Evening,
Beautiful Star, shone brilliantly, adorning the sky with those
"Neutral" tints which have characterized all British skies ever
since this War broke out.</p>
<p>Philander sat on the Canada Line, playing with his Yard-stick,
and perhaps about to take the measure of an unmade piece of calico;
when Mabel, with a wild cry of joy, sprang from a small boat to his
side.&nbsp; The meeting was too much.&nbsp; They divided a good
square faint between them this time.&nbsp; At last Philander found
his utterance, and said, "Do they think of me at Home, do they ever
think of me?"</p>
<p>"No," she replied, "but they do at the recruiting office."</p>
<p>"Ha! 'tis well."</p>
<p>"Nay, dearest," Mabel pleaded, "come home and go to the war like
a man!&nbsp; I will take your place in the Dry Goods store.&nbsp;
True, a musket is a little heavier than a yardstick, but isn't it a
rather more manly weapon?"</p>
<p>"I don't see it," was Philander's reply; "besides, this war
isn't conducted accordin' to the Constitution and Union.&nbsp; When
it is&mdash;when it is, Mabeyuel, I will return and enlist as a
Convalescent!"</p>
<p>"Then, sir," she said, with much American disgust in her
countenance, "then, sir, farewell!"</p>
<p>"Farewell!" he said, "and When this Cruel War is Over, pray that
we may meet again!"</p>
<p>"Nary!" cried Mabel, her eyes flashing warm
fire,&mdash;"nary.&nbsp; None but the Brave deserve the Sanitary
Fair!&nbsp; A man who will desert his country in its hour of trial
would drop Faro checks into the Contribution Box on Sunday.&nbsp; I
hain't got time to tarry&mdash;I hain't got time to stay!&mdash;but

<p>In a sumptuously furnished parlor in Fifth Avenue, New York, sat
a proud and haughty belle.&nbsp; Her name was Isabel
Sawtelle.&nbsp; Her father was a millionaire, and his ships, richly
laden, ploughed many a sea.</p>
<p>By the side of Isabel Sawtelle sat a young man with a clear,
beautiful eye, and a massive brow.</p>
<p>"I must go," he sed, "the foreman will wonder at my
absence."</p>
<p>"The <i>foreman</i>?" asked Isabel in a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, the foreman of the shop where I work."</p>
<p>"Foreman&mdash;shop&mdash;<i>work</i>! What! do <i>you</i>
work."</p>
<p>"Aye, Miss Sawtelle!&nbsp; I am a cooper!" and his eyes flashed
with honest pride.</p>
<p>"What's that?" she asked; "it is something about barrels, isn't
it!"</p>
<p>"It is!" he said, with a flashing nostril.&nbsp; "And
hogsheads."</p>
<p>"Then go!" she said in a tone of disdain&mdash;"go

<p>"Ha!" he cried, "you spurn me, then, because I am a
mechanic.&nbsp; Well, be it so! though the time will come, Isabel
Sawtelle," he added, and nothing could exceed his looks at this
moment&mdash;"when you will bitterly remember the cooper you now so
cruelly cast off?&nbsp; <i>Farewell!</i>"</p>

<p>Years rolled on.&nbsp; Isabel Sawtelle married a miserable

children.&nbsp; All her brothers (except one) were sent to the
penitentiary for burglary, and her mother peddles clams that are
stolen for her by little George, her only son that has his
freedom.&nbsp; Isabel's sister Bianca rides an immoral spotted
horse in the circus, <i>her</i> husband having long since been
hanged for murdering his own uncle on his mother's side.&nbsp; Thus
we see that it is always best to marry a mechanic.</p>

<center>
<p>CHAPTER I.&mdash;FRANCE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Our story opens in the early part of the year 17&mdash;.&nbsp;
France was rocking wildly from centre to circumference.&nbsp; The
arch despot and unscrupulous man, Richard the III., was trembling
like an aspen leaf upon his throne.&nbsp; He had been successful,
through the valuable aid of Richelieu and Sir. Wm. Donn, in
destroying the Orleans Dysentery, but still he trembled!&nbsp;
O'Mulligan, the snake-eater of Ireland, and Schnappsgoot of
Holland, a retired dealer in gin and sardines, had united their
forces&mdash;some nineteen men and a brace of bull pups in
all&mdash;and were overtly at work, their object being to oust the
tyrant.&nbsp; O'Mulligan was a young man between fifty-three years
of age and was chiefly distinguished for being the son of his aunt
on his great grandfather's side.&nbsp; Schnappsgoot was a man of
liberal education, having passed three weeks at Oberlin
College.&nbsp; He was a man of great hardihood, also, and would
frequently read an entire column of "railway matters" in the
"Cleveland Herald" without shrieking with agony.</p>
<center>
<p>_______________</p>
</center>
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE KING.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The tyrant Richard the III. (late Mr. Gloster) sat upon his
throne in the Palace d' St. Cloud.&nbsp; He was dressed in his best
clothes, and gorgeous trappings surrounded him everywhere.&nbsp;
Courtiers, in glittering and golden armor, stood ready at his
beck.&nbsp; He sat moodily for a while, when suddenly his sword
flashed from its silver scabbard, and he shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>"Slaves, some wine, ho!"</p>
<p>The words had scarcely escaped his lips ere a bucket of
champagne and a hoe were placed before him.</p>
<p>As the king raised the bucket to his lips, a deep voice near by,
proceeding from the mouth of the noble Count Staghisnibs,
cried&mdash;"Drink hearty, old feller."</p>
<p>"Reports traveling on lightning-wings, whisper of strange goings
on and cuttings up throughout this kingdom.&nbsp; Knowest thou
aught of these things, most noble Hellitysplit?" and the king drew
from the upper pocket of his gold-faced vest a paper of John
Anderson's solace and proceeded to take a chaw.</p>
<p>"Treason stalks monster-like throughout unhappy France, my
liege!" said the noble Hellitysplit.&nbsp; "The ranks of the
P.Q.R.'s are daily swelling, and the G.R.J.A.'s are constantly on
the increase.&nbsp; Already the peasantry scout at cat-fish, and
demand pickled salmon for their noonday repasts.&nbsp; But, my
liege," and the brave Hellitysplit eyes flashed fire, "myself and
sword are at thy command?"</p>
<p>"Bully for you, Count," said the king.&nbsp; "But soft: methinks
report&mdash;perchance unjustly&mdash;hast spoken suspiciously of
thee, most Royal d'Sardine?&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; Is it a
newspaper yarn?&nbsp; WHAT'S UP?"</p>
<p>D'Sardine meekly approached the throne, knelt at the king's
feet, and said: "Most patient, gray, and red-headed skinner; my
very approved skin-plaster: that I've been asked to drink by the
P.Q.R.'s, it is most true, true I have imbibed sundry mugs of lager
with them.&nbsp; The very head and front of my offending hath this
extent, no more."</p>
<p>"'Tis well!" said the King, rising and looking fiercely around.
"Hadst thou proved false I would with my own good sword have cut
off yer head, and spilled your ber-lud all over the floor!&nbsp; If
I wouldn't, blow me!"</p>
<center>
<p>_______________</p>
</center>
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE ROVER.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Thrilling as the scenes depicted in the preceding chapter
indubitably were, those of this are decidedly THRILLINGER.&nbsp;
Again are we in the mighty presence of the King, and again is he
surrounded by splendour and gorgeously-mailed courtiers.&nbsp; A
sea-faring man stands before him.&nbsp; It is Roberto the Rover,
disguised as a common sailor.</p>
<p>"So," said the King, "thou wouldst have audience with me!"</p>
<p>"Aye aye, yer 'onor," said the sailor, "just tip us yer grapplin
irons and pipe all hands on deck.&nbsp; Reef home yer jib poop and
splice yer main topsuls.&nbsp; Man the jibboom and let fly yer
top-gallunts.&nbsp; I've seen some salt water in my days, yer land
lubber, but shiver my timbers if I hadn't rather coast among
seagulls than landsharks.&nbsp; My name is Sweet William.&nbsp;
You're old Dick the Three.&nbsp; Ahoy!&nbsp; Awast!&nbsp; Dam my
eyes!" and Sweet William pawed the marble floor and swung his
tarpaulin after the manner of sailors on the stage, and
consequently not a bit like those on shipboard.</p>
<p>"Mariner," said the King, gravely, "thy language is exceeding
lucid, and leads me to infer that things is workin' bad."</p>
<p>"Aye, aye, my hearty!" yelled Sweet William, in dulcet strains,
reminding the King of the "voluptuous smell of physic," spoken of
by the late Mr. Byron.</p>
<p>"What wouldst thou, seafaring man?" asked the King.</p>
<p>"This!" cried the Rover, suddenly taking off his maritime
clothing and putting on an expensive suit of silk, bespangled with
diamonds.&nbsp; "This!&nbsp; I am Roberto the Rover!"</p>
<p>The King was thunder-struck.&nbsp; Cowering back in his chair of
state, he said in a tone of mingled fear and amazement, "Well, may
I be gaul-darned!"</p>
<p>"Ber-lud!&nbsp; Ber-lud!&nbsp; Ber-lud!" shrieked the Rover, as
he drew a horse-pistol and fired it at the King, who fell fatally
killed, his last words being, "WE ARE GOVENRED TOO MUCH&mdash;THIS
IS THE LAST OF EARTH!!!"&nbsp; At this exciting juncture Messrs.
O'Mulligan and Schnappsgoot (who had previously entered into a
copartnership with the Rover for the purpose of doing a general
killing business) burst into the room and cut off the heads and let
out the inwards of all the noblemen they encountered.&nbsp; They
then killed themselves and died like heroes, wrapped up in the Star
Spangled Banner, to slow music.</p>
<center>
<p>_______________</p>
</center>
<br />
<center>
<p>FINALE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The Rover fled.&nbsp; He was captured near Marseilles and thrust
into prison, where he lay for sixteen weary years, all attempts to
escape being futile.&nbsp; One night a lucky thought struck
him.&nbsp; He raised the window and got out.&nbsp; But he was
unhappy.&nbsp; Remorse and dyspepsia preyed upon his vitals.&nbsp;
He tried Boerhave's Holland Bitters and the Retired Physician's
Sands of Life, and got well.&nbsp; He then married the lovely
Countess D'Smith, and lived to a green old age, being the triumph
of virtue and downfall of vice.</p>

<p>These harsh words fell from the lips of Horace Blinker, one of
the merchant princes of New York City.&nbsp; He spoke to Clarence
Stanley, his adopted son and a beautiful youth of nineteen
summers.&nbsp; In vain did Clarence plead his poverty, his tender
age, his inexperience; in vain did he fasten those lustrous blue
eyes of his appealingly and tearfully upon Mr. Blinker, and tell
him he would make the pecuniary matter all right in the fall, and

<p>Seventeen years have become ingulfed in the vast and moist ocean
of eternity since the scene depicted in the last chapter
occurred.&nbsp; We are in Mexico.&nbsp; Come with me to the Scarlet
Banditti's cave.&nbsp; It is night.&nbsp; A tempest is raging
tempestuously without, but within we find a scene of dazzling
magnificence.&nbsp; The cave is spacious.&nbsp; Chandeliers of
solid gold hang up suspended around the gorgeously furnished room,
and the marble floor is star-studded with flashing diamonds.&nbsp;
It must have cost between two hundred dollars to fit this cave
up.&nbsp; It embraced all of the modern improvements.&nbsp; At the
head of the cave life-size photographs (by Ryder) of the bandits,
and framed in gilt, were hung up suspended.&nbsp; The bandits were
seated around a marble table, which was sculped regardless of
expense, and were drinking gin and molasses out of golden
goblets.&nbsp; When they got out of gin fresh supplies were brought
in by slaves from a two-horse wagon outside, which had been
captured that day, after a desperate and bloody struggle, by the
bandits, on the plains of Buena Vista.</p>
<p>At the head of the table sat the Chief.&nbsp; His features were
swarthy but elegant.&nbsp; He was splendidly dressed in new
clothes, and had that voluptuous, dreamy air of grandeur about him
which would at once rivet the gaze of folks generally.&nbsp; In
answer to a highly enthusiastic call he arose and delivered an able
and eloquent speech.&nbsp; We regret that our space does not permit
us to give this truly great speech in full&mdash;we can merely give
a synopsis of the distinguished speaker's remarks.&nbsp; "Comrades!
listen to your chief.&nbsp; You all know my position on
Lecompton.&nbsp; Where I stand in regard to low tolls on the Ohio
Canal is equally clear to you, and so with the Central American
question.&nbsp; I believe I understand my little Biz.&nbsp; I
decline defining my position on the Horse Railroad until after the
Spring Election.&nbsp; Whichever way I says I don't say so myself
unless I says so also.&nbsp; Comrades! be virtuous and you'll be
happy."&nbsp; The Chief sat down amidst great applause, and was
immediately presented with an elegant gold headed cane by his
comrades, as a slight testimonial of their respect.</p>

</center>
<p>Two hours later.&nbsp; Return we again to the Banditti's
Cave.&nbsp; Revelry still holds high carnival among the able and
efficient bandits.&nbsp; A knock is heard at the door.&nbsp; From
his throne at the head of the table the Chief cries, "Come in!" and
an old man, haggard, white-haired, and sadly bent, enters the
cave.</p>
<p>"Messieurs," he tremblingly ejaculates, "for seventeen years I
have not tasted of food!"</p>
<p>"Well," says a kind-hearted bandit, "if that's so I expect you
must be rather faint.&nbsp; We'll get you up a warm meal
immediately, stranger."</p>
<p>"Hold!" whispered the Chief in tones of thunder, and rushing
slowly to the spot; "this is about played out.&nbsp; Behold in me
RED HAND, the Bandit Chief, once Clarence Stanley, whom you cruelly
turned into a cold world seventeen years ago this very night!&nbsp;
Old man, perpare to go up!"&nbsp; Saying which the Chief drew a
sharp carving knife and cut off Mr. Blinker's ears.&nbsp; He then
scalped Mr. B., and cut all of his toes off.&nbsp; The old man
struggled to extricate himself from his unpleasant situation, but
was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"My goodness," he piteously exclaimed, "I must say you are
pretty rough.&nbsp; It seems to me&mdash;."</p>

<br />
<center>
<p>I.&mdash;THE PEACEFUL HAMLET.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Nestling among the grand hills of New Hampshire, in the United
States of America, is a village called Waterbury.</p>
<p>Perhaps you were never there.</p>
<p>I do not censure you if you never were.</p>
<p>One can get on very well without going to Waterbury.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are millions of meritorious persons who were never
there, and yet they are happy.</p>
<p>In this peaceful hamlet lived a young man named Pettingill.</p>
<p>Reuben Pettingill.</p>
<p>He was an agriculturist.</p>
<p>A broad-shouldered, deep-chested agriculturist.</p>
<p>He was contented to live in this peaceful hamlet.</p>
<p>He said it was better than a noisy Othello.</p>
<p>Thus do these simple children of nature joke in a first class
manner.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>II.&mdash;MYSELF.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>I write this romance in the French style.</p>
<p>Yes: something that way.</p>
<p>The French style consists of making just as many paragraphs as
possible.</p>
<p>Thus one may fill up a column in a very short time.</p>
<p>I am paid by the column, and the quicker I can fill up a
column&mdash;but this is a matter to which we will not refer.</p>
<p>We will let this matter pass.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>III.&mdash;PETTINGILL.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Reuben Pettingill was extremely industrious.</p>
<p>He worked hard all the year round on his father's little
farm.</p>
<p>Right he was!</p>
<p>Industry is a very fine thing.</p>
<p>It is one of the finest things of which we have any
knowledge.</p>
<p>Yet do not frown, "do not weep for me," when I state that I
don't like it.</p>
<p>It doesn't agree with me.</p>
<p>I prefer indolence.</p>
<p>I am happiest when I am idle.</p>
<p>I could live for months without performing any kind of labour,
and at the expiration of that time I should feel fresh and vigorous
enough to go right on in the same way for numerous more months.</p>
<p>This should not surprise you.</p>
<p>Nothing that a modern novelist does should excite astonishment
in any well-regulated mind.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>IV.&mdash;INDEPENDENCE DAY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The 4th of July is always celebrated in America with guns, and
processions, and banners, and all those things.</p>
<p>You know why we celebrate this day.</p>
<p>The American Revolution, in 1775, was perhaps one of the finest
revolutions that was ever seen.&nbsp; But I have not time to give
you a full history of the American Revolution.&nbsp; It would
consume years to do it, and I might weary you.</p>
<p>One 4th of July Reuben Pettingill went to Boston.</p>
<p>He saw great sights.</p>
<p>He saw the dense throng of people, the gay volunteers, the
banners, and, above all, he saw the fireworks.</p>
<p>I despise myself for using so low a word, but the fireworks
"licked" him.</p>
<p>A new world was opened to this young man.</p>
<p>He returned to his parents and the little farm among the hills,
with his heart full of fireworks.</p>
<p>He said, "I will make some myself."</p>
<p>He said this while eating a lobster on top of the coach.</p>
<p>He was an extraordinary skilful young man in the use of a common
clasp-knife.</p>
<p>With that simple weapon he could make, from soft wood, horses,
dogs, cats, etc.&nbsp; He carved excellent soldiers also.</p>
<p>I remember his masterpiece.</p>
<p>It was "Napoleon crossing the Alps."</p>
<p>Looking at it critically, I should say it was rather short of
Alps.</p>
<p>An Alp or two more would have improved it; but, as a whole, it
was a wonderful piece of work; and what a wonderful piece of work
is a wooden man, when his legs and arms are all right.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>V.&mdash;WHAT THIS YOUNG MAN SAID.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>He said, "I can make just as good fireworks as them in
Boston."</p>
<p>"Them" was not grammatical, but why care for grammar as long as
we are good?</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>VI.&mdash;THE FATHER'S TEARS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Pettingill neglected the farm.</p>
<p>He said that it might till itself&mdash;he should manufacture
some gorgeous fireworks, and exhibit them on the village green on
the next 4th of July.</p>
<p>He said the Eagle of Fame would flap his wings over their humble
roof ere many months should pass away.</p>
<p>"If he does," said old Mr. Pettingill, "we must shoot him and
bile him, and eat him, because we shall be rather short of meat, my
son, if you go on in this lazy way."</p>
<p>And the old man wept.</p>
<p>He shed over 120 gallons of tears.</p>
<p>That is to say, a puncheon.&nbsp; But by all means let us avoid
turning this romance into a farce.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>VII.&mdash;PYROTECHNY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>But the headstrong young man went to work, making fireworks.</p>
<p>He bought and carefully studied a work on pyrotechny.</p>
<p>The villagers knew that he was a remarkably skilful young man,
and they all said, "We shall have a great treat next 4th of
July."</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pettingill worked away.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>VIII.&mdash;THE DAY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The great day came at last.</p>
<p>Thousands poured into the little village from far and near.</p>
<p>There was an oration, of course.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>IX.&mdash;ORATORY IN AMERICA.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Yes; there was an oration.</p>
<p>We have a passion for oratory in America&mdash;political oratory
chiefly.</p>
<p>Our political orators never lose a chance to "express their
views."</p>
<p>They will do it.&nbsp; You cannot stop them.</p>
<p>There was an execution in Ohio one day, and the Sheriff, before
placing the rope round the murderer's neck, asked him if he had any
remarks to make?</p>
<p>"If he hasn't," said a well-known local orator, pushing his way
rapidly through the dense crowd to the gallows&mdash;"if our
ill-starred feller-citizen don't feel inclined to make a speech and
is in no hurry, I should like to avail myself of the present
occasion to make some remarks on the necessity of a new protective
tariff!"</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>X.&mdash;PETTINGILL'S FIREWORKS.</p>
</center>
<p>As I said in Chapter VIII., there was an oration.&nbsp; There
were also processions, and guns, and banners.</p>
<p>"This evening," said the chairman of the committee of
arrangements, "this evening, fellow-citizens, there will be a grand
display of fireworks on the village green, superintended by the
inventor and manufacturer, our public-spirited townsman, Mr. Reuben
Pettingill."</p>
<p>Night closed in, and an immense concourse of people gathered on
the village green.</p>
<p>On a raised platform, amidst his fireworks, stood
Pettingill.</p>
<p>He felt that the great hour of his life had come, and, in a
firm, clear voice, he said:</p>
<p>"The fust fireworks, feller-citizens, will be a rocket, which
will go up in the air, bust, and assume the shape of a
serpint."</p>
<p>He applied a match to the rocket, but instead of going up in the
air, it flew wildly down into the grass, running some distance with
a hissing kind of sound, and causing the masses to jump round in a
very insane manner.</p>
<p>Pettingill was disappointed, but not disheartened.&nbsp; He
tried again.</p>
<p>"The next fireworks," he said, "will go up in the air, bust, and
become a beautiful revolvin' wheel."</p>
<p>But alas! it didn't.&nbsp; It only ploughed a little furrow in
the green grass, like its unhappy predecessor.</p>
<p>The masses laughed at this, and one man&mdash;a white-haired old
villager&mdash;said, kindly but firmly, "Reuben, I'm 'fraid you
don't understand pyrotechny."</p>
<p>Reuben was amazed.&nbsp; Why did his rockets go down instead of
up?&nbsp; But, perhaps, the others would be more successful, and,
with a flushed face, and in a voice scarcely as firm as before, he
said:</p>
<p>"The next specimen of pyrotechny will go up in the air, bust,
and become an eagle.&nbsp; Said eagle will soar away into the
western skies, leavin' a red trail behind him as he so soars."</p>
<p>But, alas! again.&nbsp; No eagle soared, but, on the contrary,
that ordinary proud bird buried its head in the grass.</p>
<p>The people were dissatisfied.&nbsp; They made sarcastic
remarks.&nbsp; Some of them howled angrily.&nbsp; The aged man who
had before spoken said, "No, Reuben, you evidently don't understand
pyrotechny."</p>
<p>Pettingill boiled with rage and disappointment.</p>
<p>"You don't understand pyrotechny!" the masses shouted.</p>
<p>Then they laughed in a disagreeable manner, and some unfeeling
lads threw dirt at our hero.</p>
<p>"You don't understand pyrotechny!" the masses yelled again.</p>
<p>"Don't I?" screamed Pettingill, wild with rage; "don't you think
I do?"</p>
<p>Then seizing several gigantic rockets he placed them over a box
of powder, and touched the whole off.</p>
<p><i>This</i> rocket went up.&nbsp; It did, indeed.</p>
<p>There was a terrific explosion.</p>
<p>No one was killed, fortunately; though many were injured.</p>
<p>The platform was almost torn to pieces.</p>
<p>But proudly erect among the falling timbers stood Pettingill,
his face flashing with wild triumph; and he shouted: "If I'm any
judge of pyrotechny, <i>That</i> rocket has went off."</p>
<p>Then seeing that all the fingers on his right hand had been
taken close off in the explosion, he added: "And I ain't so
dreadful certain but four of my fingers has went off with it,
because I don't see 'em here now!"</p>

ROMANCE&mdash;REGINALD GLOVERSON.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE MORMON'S DEPARTURE.</p>
<br />
<p>The morning on which Reginald Gloverson was to leave Great Salt
Lake City with a mule-train, dawned beautifully.</p>
<p>Reginald Gloverson was a young and thrifty Mormon, with an
interesting family of twenty young and handsome wives.&nbsp; His
unions had never been blessed with children.&nbsp; As often as once
a year he used to go to Omaha, in Nebraska, with a mule-train for
goods; but although he had performed the rather perilous journey
many times with entire safety, his heart was strangely sad on this
particular morning, and filled with gloomy forebodings.</p>
<p>The time for his departure had arrived.&nbsp; The high-spirited
mules were at the door, impatiently champing their bits.&nbsp; The
Mormon stood sadly among his weeping wives.</p>
<p>"Dearest ones," he said, "I am singularly sad at heart, this
morning; but do not let this depress you.&nbsp; The journey is a
perilous one, but&mdash;pshaw! I have always come back safely
heretofore, and why should I fear?&nbsp; Besides, I know that every
night, as I lay down on the broad starlit prairie, your bright
faces will come to me in my dreams, and make my slumbers sweet and
gentle.&nbsp; You, Emily, with your mild blue eyes; and you,
Henrietta, with your splendid black hair; and you, Nelly, with your
hair so brightly, beautifully golden; and you, Mollie, with your
cheeks so downy; and you, Betsy, with your wine-red lips&mdash;far
more delicious, though, than any wine I ever tasted&mdash;and you,
Maria, with your winsome voice; and you, Susan, with
your&mdash;with your&mdash;that is to say, Susan, with
your&mdash;and the other thirteen of you, each so good and
beautiful, will come to me in sweet dreams, will you not,
Dearestists?"</p>
<p>"Our own," they lovingly chimed, "we will!"</p>
<p>"And so farewell!" said Reginald.&nbsp; "Come to my arms, my
own!" he cried, "that is, as many of you as can do it conveniently
at once, for I must away."</p>
<p>He folded several of them to his throbbing breast, and drove
sadly away.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>But he had not gone far when the trace of the off-hind mule
became unhitched.&nbsp; Dismounting, he essayed to adjust the
trace; but ere he had fairly commenced the task, the mule, a
singularly refractory animal&mdash;snorted wildly, and kicked
Reginald frightfully in the stomach.&nbsp; He arose with
difficulty, and tottered feebly towards his mother's house, which
was near by, falling dead in her yard, with the remark, "Dear
Mother, I've come home to die!"</p>
<p>"So I see," she said; "where's the mules?"</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; Reginald Gloverson could give no answer.&nbsp; In
vain the heart-stricken mother threw herself upon his inanimate
form, crying, "Oh, my son&mdash;my son!&nbsp; Only tell me where
the mules are, and then you may die if you want to."</p>
<p>In vain&mdash;in vain!&nbsp; Reginald had passed on.</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER II.&mdash;FUNERAL TRAPPINGS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The mules were never found.</p>
<p>Reginald's heart-broken mother took the body home to her
unfortunate son's widows.&nbsp; But before her arrival she
indiscreetly sent a boy to Bust the news gently to the afflicted
wives, which he did by informing them in a hoarse whisper that
their "old man had gone in."</p>
<p>The wives felt very badly indeed.</p>
<p>"He was devoted to me," sobbed Emily.</p>
<p>"And to me," said Maria.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Emily, "he thought considerably of you, but not so
much as he did of me."</p>
<p>"I say he did!"</p>
<p>"And I say he didn't!"</p>
<p>"He did!"</p>
<p>"He didn't!"</p>
<p>"Don't look at <i>me</i>, with your squint eyes!"</p>
<p>"Don't shake your red head at <i>me</i>!"</p>
<p>"Sisters!" said the black-haired Henrietta, "cease this unseemly
wrangling.&nbsp; I, as his first wife, shall strew flowers on his
grave."</p>
<p>"No you <i>won't</i>," said Susan.&nbsp; "I, as his last wife,
shall strew flowers on his grave.&nbsp; It's <i>my</i> business to
strew!"</p>
<p>"You shan't, so there!" said Henrietta.</p>
<p>"You bet I will!" said Susan, with a tear-suffused cheek.</p>
<p>"Well, as for me," said the practical Betsy, "I ain't on the
Strew, much, but I shall ride at the head of the funeral
procession!"</p>
<p>"Not if I've been introduced to myself, you won't," said the
golden-haired Nelly; "that's my position.&nbsp; You bet your
bonnet-strings it is."</p>
<p>"Children," said Reginald's mother, "you must do some crying,
you know, on the day of the funeral; and how many
pocket-handkerchers will it take to go round?&nbsp; Betsy, you and
Nelly ought to make one do between you."</p>
<p>"I'll tear her eyes out if she perpetrates a sob on my
handkercher!" said Nelly.</p>
<p>"Dear daughters in-law," said Reginald's mother, "how unseemly
is this anger!&nbsp; Mules is five hundred dollars a span, and
every identical mule my poor boy had has been gobbled up by the red
man.&nbsp; I knew when my Reginald staggered into the door-yard
that he was on the Die, but if I'd only thunk to ask him about them
mules ere his gentle spirit took flight, it would have been four
thousand dollars in <i>our</i> pockets, and <i>no</i>
mistake!&nbsp; Excuse those real tears, but you've never felt a
parent's feelin's."</p>
<p>"It's an oversight," sobbed Maria.&nbsp; "Don't blame us!"</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER III.&mdash;DUST TO DUST.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The funeral passed off in a very pleasant manner, nothing
occuring to mar the harmony of the occasion.&nbsp; By a happy
thought of Reginald's mother, the wives walked to the grave twenty
abreast, which rendered that part of the ceremony thoroughly
impartial.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>That night the twenty wives, with heavy hearts, sought their
twenty respective couches.&nbsp; But no Reginald occupied those
twenty respective couches&mdash;Reginald would never more linger
all night in blissful repose in those twenty respective
couches&mdash;Reginald's head would never more press the twenty
respective pillows of those twenty respective couches&mdash;never,
nevermore!<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>In another house, not many leagues from the House of Mourning, a
gray-haired woman was weeping passionately.&nbsp; "He died," she
cried, "he died without sigerfyin', in any respect, where them
mules went to!"</p>
<br />
<center>
<p>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;MARRIED AGAIN.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Two years are supposed to elapse between the third and fourth
chapters of this original American romance.</p>
<p>A manly Mormon, one evening, as the sun was preparing to set
among a select apartment of gold and crimson clouds in the western
horizon&mdash;although for that matter the sun has a right to "set"
where it wants to, and so, I may add has a hen&mdash;a manly
Mormon, I say, tapped gently at the door of the mansion of the late
Reginald Gloverson.</p>
<p>The door was opened by Mrs. Sarah Gloverson.</p>
<p>"Is this the house of the widow Gloverson!" the Mormon
asked.</p>
<p>"It is," said Susan.</p>
<p>"And how many is there of she?" inquired the Mormon.</p>
<p>"There is about twenty of her, including me," courteously
returned the fair Susan.</p>
<p>"Can I see her?"</p>
<p>"You can."</p>
<p>"Madam," he softly said, addressing the twenty disconsolate
widows.&nbsp; "I have seen part of you before!&nbsp; And although I
have already twenty-five wives, whom I respect and tenderly care
for, I can truly say that I never felt love's holy thrill till I
saw thee!&nbsp; Be mine&mdash;be mine!" he enthusiastically cried,
"and we will show the world a striking illustration of the beauty
and truth of the noble lines, only a good deal more so&mdash;</p>
<center>
<p>"Twenty-one souls with a single thought,<br />
&nbsp;Twenty-one hearts that beat as one!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</center>
<p>They were united, they were!</p>
<p>Gentle reader, does not the moral of this romance show
that&mdash;does it not, in fact, show that however many there may
be of a young widow woman, or rather does it not show that whatever
number of persons one woman may consist of&mdash;well, never mind
what it <i>shows</i>.&nbsp; Only this writing Mormon romances is
confusing to the intellect.&nbsp; You try it and see.</p>

<center>
<p>ON THE STEAMER.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p align="right">New York, Oct. 13, 1868.</p>
<br />
<p>The steamer Ariel starts for California at noon.</p>
<p>Her decks are crowded with excited passengers, who instantly
undertake to "look after" their trunks and things; and what with
our smashing against each other, and the yells of the porters, and
the wails over lost baggage, and the crash of boxes, and the roar
of the boilers, we are for the time being about as unhappy a lot of
maniacs as was ever thrown together.</p>
<p>I am one of them.&nbsp; I am rushing around with a glaring eye
in search of a box.</p>
<p>Great jam, in which I find a sweet young lady, with golden hair,
clinging to me fondly, and saying, "Dear George,
farewell!"&mdash;Discovers her mistake, and disappears.</p>
<p>I should like to be George some more.</p>
<p>Confusion so great that I seek refuge in a stateroom which
contains a single lady of forty-five summers, who says, "Base man!
leave me!"&nbsp; I leave her.</p>
<p>By and by we cool down, and become somewhat regulated.</p>
<p>The next day and the next pass by in a serene manner.&nbsp; The
waves are smooth now, and we can all eat and sleep.&nbsp; We might
have enjoyed ourselves very well, I fancy, if the Ariel, whose
capacity was about three hundred and fifty passengers, had not on
this occasion carried nearly nine hundred, a hundred at least of
whom were children of an unpleasant age.&nbsp; Captain Semmes
captured the Ariel once, and it is to be deeply regretted that that
thrifty buccaneer hadn't made mince-meat of her, because she is a
miserable tub at best, and hasn't much more right to be afloat than
a second-hand coffin has.&nbsp; I do not know her proprietor, Mr.
C. Vanderbilt.&nbsp; But I know of several excellent mill
privileges in the State of Maine, and not one of them is so
thoroughly <i>Dam'd</i> as he was all the way from New York to
Aspinwall.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I have spoken my Piece about the Ariel, and I hope Mr.
Vanderbilt will reform ere it is too late.&nbsp; Dr. Watts says the
vilest sinner may return as long as the gas-meters work well, or
words to that effect.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>We were so densely crowded on board the Ariel that I cannot
conscientiously say we were altogether happy.&nbsp; And sea-voyages
at best are a little stupid.&nbsp; On the whole I should prefer a
voyage on the Erie Canal, where there isn't any danger, and where
you can carry picturesque scenery along with you&mdash;so to
speak.</p>
<center>_______________</center>
<br />
<center>
<p><a name="isthmus" id="isthmus"></a>II.</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>THE ISTHMUS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>On the ninth day we reach Aspinwall in the Republic of
Granada.&nbsp; The President of New Granada is a Central American
named Mosquero.&nbsp; I was told that he derived quite a portion of
his income by carrying passengers' valises and things from the
steamer to the hotels in Aspinwall.&nbsp; It was an infamous
falsehood.&nbsp; Fancy A. Lincoln carrying carpet-bags and things!
and indeed I should rather trust him with them than Mosquero,
because the former gentleman, as I think some one has before
observed, is "honest."</p>
<p>I intrust my bag to a speckled native, who confidentially gives
me to understand that he is the only strictly honest person in
Aspinwall.&nbsp; The rest, he says, are niggers&mdash;which the
colored people of the Isthmus regard as about as scathing a thing
as they can say of one another.</p>
<p>I examine the New Grenadian flag, which waves from the
chamber-window of the refreshment saloon.&nbsp; It is of simple
design.&nbsp; You can make one.</p>
<p>Take half of a cotton shirt, that has been worn two months, and
dip it in molasses of the Day &amp; Martin brand.&nbsp; Then let
the flies gambol over it for a few days, and you have it.&nbsp; It
is an emblem of Sweet Liberty.</p>
<p>At the Howard House the man of sin rubbeth the hair of the horse
to the bowels of the cat, and our girls are waving their lily-white
hoofs in the dazzling waltz.</p>
<p>We have a quadrille, in which an English person slips up and
jams his massive brow against my stomach.&nbsp; He apologizes, and
I say, "all right, my lord."&nbsp; I subsequently ascertained that
he superintended the shipping of coals for the British steamers,
and owned fighting cocks.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>The natives amass wealth by carrying valises, &amp;c., then
squander it for liquor.&nbsp; My native comes to me as I sit on the
veranda of the Howard House smoking a cigar, and solicits the job
of taking my things to the cars next morning.&nbsp; He is
intoxicated, and has been fighting, to the palpable detriment of
his wearing apparel; for he has only a pair of tattered pantaloons
and a very small quantity of shirt left.</p>
<p>We go to bed.&nbsp; Eight of us are assigned to a small den
upstairs, with only two lame apologies for beds.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes and even rats annoy us fearfully.&nbsp; One bold rat
gnaws at the feet of a young Englishman in the party.&nbsp; This
was more than the young Englishman could stand, and rising from his
bed he asked us if New Grenada wasn't a Republic?&nbsp; We said it
was.&nbsp; "I thought so," he said.&nbsp; "Of course I mean no
disrespect to the United States of America in the remark, but I
think I prefer a bloated monarchy!"&nbsp; He smiled
sadly&mdash;then handing his purse and his mother's photograph to
another English person, he whispered softly, "If I am eaten up,
give them to Me mother&mdash;tell her I died like a true Briton,
with no faith whatever in the success of a republican form of
government!"&nbsp; And then he crept back to bed again.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>We start at seven the next morning for Panama.</p>
<p>My native comes bright and early to transport my carpet sack to
the railway station.&nbsp; His clothes have suffered still more
during the night, for he comes to me now dressed only in a small
rag and one boot.</p>
<p>At last we are off.&nbsp; "Adios, Americanos!" the natives cry;
to which I pleasantly reply, "<i>Adous!</i> and long may it be
before you have a chance to Do us again."</p>
<p>The cars are comfortable on the Panama railway, and the country
through which we pass is very beautiful.&nbsp; But it will not do
to trust it much, because it breeds fevers and other unpleasant
disorders, at all seasons of the year.&nbsp; Like a girl we most
all have known, the Isthmus is fair but false.</p>
<p>There are mud huts all along the route, and half-naked savages
gaze patronizingly upon us from their doorways.&nbsp; An elderly
lady in spectacles appears to be much scandalized by the scant
dress of these people, and wants to know why the Select Men don't
put a stop to it.&nbsp; From this, and a remark she incidentally
makes about her son, who has invented a washing machine which will
wash, wring, and dry a shirt in ten minutes, I infer that she is
from the hills of Old New England, like the Hutchinson
family.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>The Central American is lazy.&nbsp; The only exercise he ever
takes is to occasionally produce a Revolution.&nbsp; When his feet
begin to swell and there are premonitory symptoms of gout, he
"revolushes" a spell, and then serenely returns to his cigarette
and hammock under the palm-trees.</p>
<p>These Central American Republics are queer concerns.&nbsp; I do
not of course precisely know what a last year's calf's ideas of
immortal glory may be, but probably they are about as lucid as
those of a Central American in regard to a republican form of
government.</p>
<p>And yet I am told they are a kindly people in the main.&nbsp; I
never met but one of them&mdash;a Costa-Rican; on board the
Ariel.&nbsp; He lay sick with fever, and I went to him and took his
hot hand gently in mine.&nbsp; I shall never forget his look of
gratitude.&nbsp; And the next day he borrowed five dollars of me,
shedding tears as he put it in his pocket.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>The Senoritas who leave us at Panama are splendid
creatures.&nbsp; They learned me Spanish, and in the soft moonlight
we walked on deck and talked of the land of Pizarro.&nbsp; (You
know old Piz. conquered Peru! and although he was not educated at
West Point, he had still some military talent.)&nbsp; I feel as
though I had lost all my relations, including my grandmother and
the cooking stove when these gay young Senoritas go away.</p>
<p>They do not go to Peru on a Peruvian bark, but on an English
steamer.&nbsp; Off to Acapulco.</p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
<p>MEXICO.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>We make Acapulco, a Mexican coast town of some importance, in a
few days, and all go ashore.</p>
<p>The pretty peasant girls peddle necklaces made of shells and
oranges, in the streets of Acapulco, on steamer days.&nbsp; They
are quite naive about it.&nbsp; Handing you a necklace they will
say, "Me give you pres-<i>ent</i>, Senor," and then retire with a
low curtsey.&nbsp; Returning, however, in a few moments, they say
quite sweetly, "You give me pres-<i>ent</i>, Senor, of quarter
dollar!" which you at once do unless you have a heart of stone.</p>
<p>Acapulco was shelled by the French a year or so before our
arrival there, and they effected a landing.&nbsp; But the gay and
gallant Mexicans peppered them so persisently and effectually from
the mountains near by that they concluded to sell out and
leave.</p>
<p>Napoleon has no right in Mexico.&nbsp; Mexico may deserve a
licking.&nbsp; That is possible enough.&nbsp; Most people do.&nbsp;
But nobody has any right to lick Mexico except the United
States.&nbsp; We have a right, I flatter myself, to lick this
entire continent, including ourselves, any time we want
to.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>The signal gun is fired at 11, and we go off to the steamer in
small boats.</p>
<p>We reach Manzanillo, another coast place, twenty-four hours
after leaving Acapulco.&nbsp; Manzanillo is a little Mexican
village, and looked very wretched indeed, sweltering away there on
the hot sands.&nbsp; But it is a port of some importance,
nevertheless, because a great deal of merchandise finds its way to
the interior from there.&nbsp; The white and green flag of Mexico
floats from a red steam-tug (the navy of Mexico, by the way,
consists of two tugs, a disabled raft, and a basswood
life-preserver), and the Captain of the Port comes off to us in his
small boat, climbs up the side of the St. Louis, and folds the
healthy form of Captain Hudson to his breast.&nbsp; There is no
wharf here, and we have to anchor off the town.</p>
<p>There was a wharf, but the enterprising Mexican peasantry, who
subsist by poling merchandise ashore in dug-outs, indignantly tore
it up.&nbsp; We take on here some young Mexicans, from Colima, who
are going to California.&nbsp; They are of the better class, and
one young man (who was educated in Madrid) speaks English rather
better than I write it.&nbsp; Be careful not to admire any article
of an educated Mexican's dress, because if you do he will take it
right off and give it to you, and sometimes this might be
awkward.</p>
<p>I said: "What a beautiful cravat you wear!"</p>
<p>"It is yours!" he exclaimed, quickly unbuckling it; and I could
not induce him to take it back again.</p>
<p>I am glad I did not tell his sister, who was with him and with
whom I was lucky enough to get acquainted, what a beautiful white
hand she had.&nbsp; She might have given it to me on the spot; and
that, as she had soft eyes, a queenly form, and a half million or
so in her own right, would have made me feel bad.</p>
<p>Reports reach us here of high-handed robberies by the banditti
all along the road to the City of Mexico.&nbsp; They steal clothes
as well as coin.&nbsp; A few days since the mail coach entered the
city with all the passengers stark-naked!&nbsp; They must have felt
mortified.</p>

<center>
<p>CALIFORNIA.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>We reach San Francisco one Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; I am driven
to the Occidental Hotel by a kind-hearted hackman, who states that
inasmuch as I have come out there to amuse people, he will only
charge me five dollars.&nbsp; I pay it in gold, of course, because
greenbacks are not current on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Many of the citizens of San Francisco remember the Sabbath day
to keep it jolly; and the theatres, the circus, the minstrels, and
the music halls are all in full blast to-night.</p>
<p>I "compromise," and go to the Chinese theatre, thinking perhaps
there can be no great harm in listening to worldly sentiments when
expressed in a language I don't understand.</p>
<p>The Chinaman at the door takes my ticket with the remark, "Ki
hi-hi ki! Shoolah!"</p>
<p>And I tell him that on the whole I think he is right.</p>
<p>The Chinese play is "continued," like a Ledger story, from night
to night.&nbsp; It commences with the birth of the hero or heroine,
which interesting event occurs publicly on the stage; and then
follows him or her down to the grave, where it cheerfully ends.</p>
<p>Sometimes a Chinese play lasts six months.&nbsp; The play I am
speaking of had been going on for about two months.&nbsp; The
heroine had grown up into womanhood, and was on the point, as I
inferred, of being married to a young Chinaman in spangled
pantaloons and a long black tail.&nbsp; The bride's father comes in
with his arms full of tea-chests, and bestows them, with his
blessing, upon the happy couple.&nbsp; As this play is to run four
months longer, however, and as my time is limited, I go away at the
close of the second act, while the orchestra is performing an
overture on gongs and one-stringed fiddles.</p>
<p>The door-keeper again says, "Ki hi-hi ki! Shoolah!" adding, this
time however, "Chow-wow."&nbsp; I agree with him in regard to the
ki hi and hi ki, but tell him I don't feel altogether certain about
the chow-wow.</p>
<p>To Stockton from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Stockton is a beautiful town, that has ceased to think of
becoming a very large place, and has quietly settled down into a
state of serene prosperity.&nbsp; I have my boots repaired here by
an artist who informs me that he studied in the penitentiary; and I
visit the lunatic asylum, where I encounter a vivacious maniac who
invites me to ride in a chariot drawn by eight lions and a
rhinoceros.</p>
<p>John Phoenix was once stationed at Stockton, and put his mother
aboard the San Francisco boat one morning with the sparkling
remark, "Dear mother, be virtuous and you will be happy!"<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>Forward to Sacramento&mdash;which is the capital of the State,
and a very nice old town.</p>
<p>They had a flood here some years ago, during which several
blocks of buildings sailed out of town and had never been heard
from since.&nbsp; A Chinaman concluded to leave in a wash tub, and
actually set sail in one of those fragile barks.&nbsp; A drowning
man hailed him piteously, thus: "Throw me a rope, oh throw me a
rope!" To which the Chinaman excitedly cried, "No have
got&mdash;how can do?" and went on, on with the howling
current.&nbsp; He was never seen more; but a few weeks after his
tail was found by some Sabbath-school children in the north part of
the State.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I go to the mountain towns.&nbsp; The sensational mining days
are over, but I find the people jolly and hospitable
nevertheless.</p>
<p>At Nevada I am called upon, shortly after my arrival, by an
athletic scarlet-faced man, who politely says his name is
Blaze.</p>
<p>Years ago Mr. Blaze was an agent of the California Stage
Company.&nbsp; There was a formidable and well-organized opposition
to the California Stage Company at that time, and Mr. Blaze
rendered them such signal service in his capacity of agent that
they were very sorry when he tendered his resignation.</p>
<p>"You are some sixteen hundred dollars behind in your accounts,
Mr. Blaze," said the President, "but in view of your faithful and
efficient services we shall throw off eight hundred dollars off
that amount."</p>
<p>Mr. Blaze seemed touched by this generosity.&nbsp; A tear stood
in his eye and his bosom throbbed audibly.</p>
<p>"You <i>will</i> throw off eight hundred dollars&mdash;you
<i>will</i>?" he at last cried, seizing the President's hand and
pressing it passionately to his lips.</p>
<p>"I will," returned the President.</p>
<p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Blaze, "I'm a gentleman, I <i>am</i>, you
bet!&nbsp; And I won't allow no Stage Company to surpass me in
politeness.&nbsp; <i>I'll throw off the other eight hundred, and
we'llcall it square!</i>&nbsp; No gratitude, sir&mdash;no thanks;
it is my duty."<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I get back to San Francisco in a few weeks, and am to start home
Overland from here.</p>
<p>I do not leave the Capital of California in a light-hearted and
joyous manner.&nbsp; But "leaves have their time to fall," and I
have my time to leave, which is now.</p>
<p>We ride all day and all night, and ascend and descend some of
the most frightful hills I ever saw.&nbsp; We make Johnson's Pass,
which is 6752 feet high, about two o'clock in the morning, and go
down the great Kingsbury grade with locked wheels.&nbsp; The
driver, with whom I sit outside, informs me, as we slowly roll down
this fearful mountain road, which looks down on either side into an
appalling ravine, that he has met accidents in his time, and cost
the California Stage Company a great deal of money; "because," he
says, "juries is agin us on principle, and every man who sues us is
sure to recover.&nbsp; But it will never be so agin, not with
<i>me</i>, you bet."</p>
<p>"How is that?" I said.</p>
<p>It was frightfully dark.&nbsp; It was snowing withal, and
notwithstanding the brakes were kept hard down, the coach slewed
wildly, often fairly touching the brink of the black precipice.</p>
<p>"How is that?" I said.</p>
<p>"Why, you see," he replied, "that corpses never sue for damages,
but maimed people do.&nbsp; And the next time I have a overturn I
shall go round and keerfully examine the passengers.&nbsp; Them as
is dead I shall let alone; but them as is mutilated I shall finish
with the king-bolt! Dead folks don't sue.&nbsp; They ain't on
it."</p>
<p>Thus with anecdote did this driver cheer me up.</p>

<p>We reach Carson City about nine o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; It
is the capital of the silver-producing territory of Nevada.</p>
<p>They shoot folks here somewhat, and the law is rather partial
than otherwise to first-class murderers.</p>
<p>I visit the territorial Prison, and the Warden points out the
prominent convicts to me thus:</p>
<p>"This man's crime was horse-stealing.&nbsp; He is here for
life."</p>
<p>"This man is in for murder.&nbsp; He is here for three
years."</p>
<p>But shooting isn't as popular in Nevada as it once was.&nbsp; A
few years since they used to have a dead man for breakfast every
morning.&nbsp; A reformed desperado told my that he supposed he had
killed men enough to stock a graveyard.&nbsp; "A feeling of
remorse," he said, "sometimes comes over me!&nbsp; But I'm an
altered man now.&nbsp; I hain't killed a man for over two
weeks!&nbsp; What'll yer poison yourself with?" he added, dealing a
resonant blow on the bar.</p>
<p>There used to live near Carson City a notorious desperado, who
never visited town without killing somebody.&nbsp; He would call
for liquor at some drinking-house, and if anybody declined joining
him he would at once commence shooting.&nbsp; But one day he shot a
man too many.&nbsp; Going into the St. Nicholas drinking-house he
asked the company present to join him in a North American
drink.&nbsp; One individual was rash enough to refuse.&nbsp; With a
look of sorrow rather than anger the desperado revealed his
revolver, and said, "Good God!&nbsp; <i>Must</i> I kill a man every
time I come to Carson?" and so saying he fired and killed the
individual on the spot.&nbsp; But this was the last murder the
bloodthirsty miscreant ever committed, for the aroused citizens
pursued him with rifles and shot him down in his own
dooryard.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I lecture in the theatre at Carson, which opens out of a
drinking and gambling house.&nbsp; On each side of the door where
my ticket-taker stands there are monte-boards and sweat-cloths, but
they are deserted to-night, the gamblers being evidently of a
literary turn of mind.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>Five years ago there was only a pony-path over the precipitous
hills on which now stands the marvelous city of Virginia, with its
population of twelve thousand persons, and perhaps more.&nbsp;
Virginia, with its stately warehouses and gay shops; its splendid
streets, paved with silver ore; its banking houses and faro-banks;
its attractive coffee-houses and elegant theatre, its music halls
and its three daily newspapers.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I visit several of the adjacent mining towns, but I do not go to
Aurora.&nbsp; No, I think not.&nbsp; A lecturer on psychology was
killed there the other night by the playful discharge of a
horse-pistol in the hands of a degenerate and intoxicated
Spaniard.&nbsp; This circumstance, and a rumor that the citizens
are "agin" literature, induce me to go back to Virginia.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I had pointed out to me at a restaurant a man who had killed
four men in street broils, and who had that very day cut his own
brother's breast open in a dangerous manner with a small supper
knife.&nbsp; He was a gentleman, however.&nbsp; I heard him tell
some men so.&nbsp; He admitted it himself.&nbsp; And I don't think
he would lie about a little thing like that.</p>
<p>The theatre at Virginia will attract the attention of the
stranger, because it is an unusually elegant affair of the kind,
and would be so regarded anywhere.&nbsp; It was built, of course,
by Mr. Thomas Maguire, the Napoleonic manager of the Pacific, and
who has built over twenty theatres in his time and will perhaps
build as many more, unless somebody stops him&mdash;which, by the
way, will not be a remarkably easy thing to do.</p>
<p>As soon as a mining camp begins to assume the proportions of a
city, at about the time the whiskey-vender draws his cork or the
gambler spreads his green cloth, Maguire opens a theatre, and with
a hastily-organized "Vigilance Committee" of actors, commences to
execute Shakespeare.</p>

<p>My arrival at Virginia City was signalized by the following
incident:</p>
<p>I had no sooner achieved my room in the garret of the
International Hotel than I was called upon by an intoxicated man
who said he was an Editor.&nbsp; Knowing how rare it was for an
Editor to be under the blighting influence of either spiritous or
malt liquors, I received this statement doubtfully.&nbsp; But I
said:</p>
<p>"What name?"</p>
<p>"Wait!" he said, and went out.</p>
<p>I heard him pacing unsteadily up and down the hall
outside.&nbsp; In ten minutes he returned, and said:</p>
<p>"Pepper!"</p>
<p>Pepper was indeed his name.&nbsp; He had been out to see if he
could remember it; and he was so flushed with his success that he
repeated it joyously several times, and then, with a short laugh he
went away.</p>
<p>I had often heard of a man being "so drunk that he didn't know
what town he lived in," but here was a man so hideously inebriated
that he didn't know what his name was.</p>
<p>I saw him no more, but I heard from him.&nbsp; For he published
a notice of my lecture, in which he said I had <i>a dissipated
air!</i></p>

<center>
<p>HORACE GREELEY'S RIDE TO PLACERVILLE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>When Mr. Greeley was in California ovations awaited him at every
town.&nbsp; He had written powerful leaders in the "Tribune" in
favor of the Pacific railroad, which had greatly endeared him to
the citizens of the Golden State.&nbsp; And therefore they made
much of him when he went to see them.</p>
<p>At one town the enthusiastic populace tore his celebrated white
coat to pieces, and carried the pieces home to remember him by.</p>
<p>The citizens of Placerville prepared to fete the great
journalist, and an extra coach, with extra relays of horses, was
chartered to the California Stage Company to carry him from Folsom
to Placerville&mdash;distance, forty miles.&nbsp; The extra was in
some way delayed, and did not leave Folsom until late in the
afternoon.&nbsp; Mr. Greeley was to be feted at 7 o'clock that
evening by the citizens of Placerville, and it was altogether
necessary that he should be there by that hour.&nbsp; So the Stage
Company said to Henry Monk, the driver of the extra: "Henry, this
great man must be there by 7 to-night."&nbsp; And Henry answered,
"The great man shall be there."</p>
<p>The roads were in an awful state, and during the first few miles
out of Folsom slow progress was made.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Greeley, "are you aware that I <i>must</i> be at
Placerville at 7 o'clock to-night?"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" laconically returned Henry Monk.</p>
<p>Still the coach dragged slowly forward.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Greeley, "this is not a trifling matter.&nbsp; I
<i>must</i> be there at 7!"</p>
<p>Again came the answer, "I've got my orders!"</p>
<p>But the speed was not increased, and Mr. Greeley chafed away
another half hour; when, as he was again about to remonstrate with
the driver, the horses suddenly started into a furious run, and all
sorts of encouraging yells filled the air from the throat of Henry
Monk.</p>
<p>"That is right, my good fellow!" cried Mr. Greeley.&nbsp; "I'll
give you ten dollars when we get to Placerville.&nbsp; Now we
<i>are</i> going!"</p>
<p>They were indeed, and at a terrible speed.</p>
<p>Crack, crack! went the whip, and again "that voice" split the
air. "Git up!&nbsp; Hi yi!&nbsp; G'long!&nbsp; Yip&mdash;yip!"</p>
<p>And on they tore over stones and ruts, up hill and down, at a
rate of speed never before achieved by stage horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Greeley, who had been bouncing from one end of the coach to
the other like an india-rubber ball, managed to get his head out of
the window, when he said:</p>
<p>"Do&mdash;on't&mdash;on't&mdash;on't you-u-u think we-e-e-e
shall get there by seven if we do&mdash;on't&mdash;on't go so
fast?"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" That was all Henry Monk said.&nbsp; And on
tore the coach.</p>
<p>It was becoming serious.&nbsp; Already the journalist was
extremely sore from the terrible jolting, and again his head "might
have been seen" at the window.</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, "I don't care&mdash;care&mdash;<i>air</i>, if we
<i>don't</i> get there at seven!"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!"&nbsp; Fresh horses.&nbsp; Forward again,
faster than before.&nbsp; Over rocks and stumps, on one of which
the coach narrowly escaped turning a summerset.</p>
<p>"See here!" shrieked Mr. Greeley, "I don't care if we don't get
there at all!"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!&nbsp; I work for the California Stage
Company, <i>I</i>do.&nbsp; That's wot I <i>work</i> for.&nbsp; They
said, 'git this man through by seving.' An' this man's goin'
through.&nbsp; You bet!&nbsp; Gerlong!&nbsp; Whoo-ep!"</p>
<p>Another frightful jolt, and Mr. Greeley's bald head suddenly
found its way through the roof of the coach, amidst the crash of
small timbers and the ripping of strong canvas.</p>
<p>"Stop, you &mdash;&mdash;maniac!" he roared.</p>
<p>Again answered Henry Monk:</p>
<p>"I've got my orders! <i>Keep your seat, Horace!</i>"</p>
<p>At Mud Springs, a village a few miles from Placerville, they met
a large delegation of the citizens of Placerville, who had come out
to meet the celebrated editor, and escort him into town.&nbsp;
There was a military company, a brass band, and a six-horse wagon
load of beautiful damsels in milk-white dresses representing all
the States in the Union.&nbsp; It was nearly dark now, but the
delegation were amply provided with torches, and bonfires blazed
all along the road to Placerville.</p>
<p>The citizens met the coach in the outskirts of Mud Springs, and
Mr. Monk reined in his foam-covered steeds.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Greeley on board?" asked the chairman of the
committee.</p>
<p>"<i>He was, a few miles back!</i>" said Mr. Monk; "yes," he
added, after looking down through the hole which the fearful
jolting had made in the coach-roof&mdash;"yes, I can see him!&nbsp;
He is there!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Greeley," said the Chairman of the Committee, presenting
himself at the window of the coach, "Mr. Greeley, sir!&nbsp; We are
come to most cordially welcome you, sir&mdash;why, God bless me,
sir, you are bleeding at the nose!"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" cried Mr. Monk.&nbsp; "My orders is as
follers: Get him there by seving!&nbsp; It wants a quarter to
seving.&nbsp; Stand out of the way!"</p>
<p>"But, sir," exclaimed the Committee-man, seizing the off leader
by the reins&mdash;"Mr Monk, we are come to escort him into
town!&nbsp; Look at the procession, sir, and the brass bands, and
the people, and the young women, sir!"</p>
<p>"<i>I've got my orders!</i>" screamed Mr. Monk.&nbsp; "My orders
don't say nothin' about no brass bands and young women.&nbsp; My
orders says, 'git him there by seving!'&nbsp; Let go them
lines!&nbsp; Clear the way there!&nbsp; Whoo-ep!&nbsp; <i>Keep your
seat, Horace!</i>" and the coach dashed wildly through the
procession, upsetting a portion of the brass band, and violently
grazing the wagon which contained the beautiful young women in
white.</p>
<p>Years hence, gray-haired men, who were little boys in this
procession, will tell their grandchildren how this stage tore
through Mud Springs, and how Horace Greeley's bald head ever and
anon showed itself, like a wild apparition, above the
coach-roof.</p>
<p>Mr. Monk was on time.&nbsp; There is a tradition that Mr.
Greeley was very indignant for a while; then he laughed, and
finally presented Mr. Monk with a brand new suit of clothes.</p>
<p>Mr. Monk himself is still in the employ of the California Stage
Company, and is rather fond of relating a story that has made him
famous all over the Pacific coast.&nbsp; But he says he yields to
no man in his admiration for Horace Greeley.</p>

<center>
<p>TO REESE RIVER.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>I leave Virginia for Great Salt Lake City, via the Reese River
Silver Diggings.</p>
<p>There are eight passengers of us inside the coach&mdash;which,
by the way, isn't a coach, but a Concord covered mud wagon.</p>
<p>Among the passengers is a genial man of the name of Ryder, who
has achieved a widespread reputation as a strangler of unpleasant
bears in the mountain fastnesses of California, and who is now an
eminent Reese River miner.</p>
<p>We ride night and day, passing through the land of the Piute
Indians.&nbsp; Reports reach us that fifteen hundred of these
savages are on the Rampage, under the command of a red usurper
named Buffalo Jim, who seems to be a sort of Jeff Davis, inasmuch
as he and his followers have seceded from the regular Piut
organization.&nbsp; The seceding savages have announced that they
shall kill and scalp all pale-faces [which makes our face pale, I
reckon] found loose in that section.&nbsp; We find the guard
doubled at all the stations where we change horses, and our
passengers nervously examine their pistols and readjust the long
littering knives in their belts.&nbsp; I feel in my pockets to see
if the key which unlocks the carpet-bag containing my revolvers is
all right&mdash;for I had rather brilliantly locked my deadly
weapons up in that article, which was strapped with the other
baggage to the rack behind.&nbsp; The passengers frown on me for
this carelessness, but the kind-hearted Ryder gives me a small
double-barrelled gun, with which I narrowly escape murdering my
beloved friend Hingston in cold blood.&nbsp; I am not used to guns
and things, and in changing the position of this weapon I pulled
the trigger rather harder than was necessary.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>When this wicked rebellion first broke out I was among the
first&mdash;to stay at home&mdash;chiefly because of my utter
ignorance of firearms.&nbsp; I should be valuable to the Army as a
Brigadier-General only so far as the moral influence of&mdash;my
name went.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>However, we pass safely through the land of the Piutes,
unmolested by Buffalo James.&nbsp; This celebrated savage can read
and write, and is quite an orator, like Metamora, or the last of
the Wampanoags.&nbsp; He went on to Washington a few years ago and
called Mr. Buchanan his Great Father, and the members of the
Cabinet his dear Brothers.&nbsp; They gave him a great many
blankets, and he returned to his beautiful hunting grounds and went
to killing stage drivers.&nbsp; He made such a fine impression upon
Mr. Buchanan during his sojourn in Washington that that statesman
gave a young English tourist, who crossed the plain a few years
since, a letter of introduction to him.&nbsp; The great Indian
chief read the English person's letter with considerable emotion,
and then ordered him scalped, and stole his trunks.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryder knows me only as "Mr. Brown," and he refreshes me
during the journey by quotations from my books and lectures.</p>
<p>"Never seen Ward?" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, no."</p>
<p>"Ward says he likes little girls, but he likes large girls just
as well.&nbsp; Haw, haw, haw!&nbsp; I should like to see the
d&mdash;- fool!"</p>
<p>He referred to me.</p>
<p>He even woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me one of
Ward's jokes.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I lecture at Big Creek.</p>
<p>Big Creek is a straggling, wild, little village; and the house
in which I had the honor of speaking a piece had no other floor
than the bare earth.&nbsp; The roof was of sagebrush.&nbsp; At one
end of the building a huge wood fire blazed, which, with
half-a-dozen tallow-candles, afforded all the illumination
desired.&nbsp; The lecturer spoke from behind the drinking
bar.&nbsp; Behind him long rows of decanters glistened; above him
hung pictures of race-horses and prize-fighters; and beside him, in
his shirt-sleeves and wearing a cheerful smile, stood the
bar-keeper.&nbsp; My speeches at the Bar before this had been of an
elegant character, perhaps, but quite brief.&nbsp; They never
extended beyond "I don't care if I do," "No sugar in mine," and
short gems of a like character.</p>
<p>I had a good audience at Big Creek, who seemed to be pleased,
the bar-keeper especially; for at the close of any "point" that I
sought to make he would deal the counter a vigorous blow with his
fist, and exclaim, "Good boy from the New England States! listen to
William W. Shakespeare!"</p>
<p>Back to Austin.&nbsp; We lose our way, and hitching our horses
to a tree, go in search of some human beings.&nbsp; The night is
very dark.&nbsp; We soon stumble upon a camp-fire, and an
unpleasantly modulated voice asks us to say our prayers, adding
that we are on the point of going to Glory with our boots on.&nbsp;
I think perhaps there may be some truth in this, as the mouth of a
horse-pistol almost grazes my forehead, while immediately behind
the butt of that death-dealing weapon I perceive a large man with
black whiskers.&nbsp; Other large men begin to assemble, also with
horse-pistols.&nbsp; Dr. Hingston hastily explains, while I go back
to the carriage to say my prayers, where there is more room.&nbsp;
The men were miners on a prospecting tour, and as we advanced upon
them without sending them word they took us for highway
robbers.</p>
<p>I must not forget to say that my brave and kind-hearted friend
Ryder of the mail coach, who had so often alluded to "Ward" in our
ride from Virginia to Austin, was among my hearers at Big
Creek.&nbsp; He had discovered who I was, and informed me that he
had debated whether to wollop me or give me some rich silver
claims.</p>

<center>
<p>GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>How was I to be greeted by the Mormons?&nbsp; That was rather an
exciting question with me.&nbsp; I had been told on the plains that
a certain humorous sketch of mine (written some years before) had
greatly incensed the Saints, and a copy of the Sacramento "Union"
newspaper had a few days before fallen into my hands in which a
Salt Lake correspondent quite clearly intimated that my reception
at the new Zion might be unpleasantly warm.&nbsp; I ate my dinner
moodily and sent out for some cigars.&nbsp; The venerable clerk
brought me six.&nbsp; They cost only two dollars.&nbsp; They were
procured at a store near by.&nbsp; The Salt Lake House sells
neither cigars nor liquors.</p>
<p>I smoke in my room, having no heart to mingle with the people in
the office.</p>
<p>Dr. Hingston "thanks God he never wrote against the Mormons,"
and goes out in search of a brother nglishman.&nbsp; Comes back at
night and says there is a prejudice against me.&nbsp; Advises me to
keep in.&nbsp; Has heard that the Mormons thirst for my blood and
are on the lookout for me.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I keep in.</p>
<p>The next day is Sunday, and we go to the Tabernacle, in the
morning.&nbsp; The Tabernacle is located on &mdash;&mdash; street,
and is a long rakish building of adobe, capable of seating some
twenty-five hundred persons.&nbsp; There is a wide platform and a
rather large pulpit at one end of the building, and at the other
end is another platform for the choir.&nbsp; A young Irishman of
the name of Sloan preaches a sensible sort of discourse, to which a
Presbyterian could hardly have objected.&nbsp; Last night this same
Mr. Sloan enacted a character in a rollicking Irish farce at the
theatre!&nbsp; And he played it well, I was told; not so well, of
course, as the great Dan Bryant could; but I fancy he was more at
home in the Mormon pulpit than Daniel would have been.</p>
<p>The Mormons, by the way, are preeminently an amusement-loving
people, and the Elders pray for the success of their theatre with
as much earnestness as they pray for anything else.&nbsp; The
congregation doesn't startle us.&nbsp; It is known, I fancy, that
the heads of the Church are to be absent to-day, and the attendance
is slim.&nbsp; There are no ravishingly beautiful women present,
and no positively ugly ones.&nbsp; The men are fair to
middling.&nbsp; They will never be slain in cold blood for their
beauty, nor shut up in jail for their homeliness.</p>
<p>There are some good voices in the choir to-day, but the
orchestral accompaniment is unusually slight.&nbsp; Sometimes they
introduce a full brass and string band in Church.&nbsp; Brigham
Young says the devil has monopolized the good music long enough,
and it is high time the Lord had a portion of it.&nbsp; Therefore
trombones are tooted on Sundays in Utah as well as on other days;
and there are some splendid musicians there.&nbsp; The Orchestra in
Brigham Young's theatre is quite equal to any in Broadway.&nbsp;
There is a youth in Salt Lake City (I forget his name) who plays
the cornet like a North American angel.</p>
<p>Mr. Stenhouse relieves me of any anxiety I had felt in regard to
having my swan-like throat cut by the Danites, but thinks my
wholesale denunciation of a people I had never seen was rather
hasty.&nbsp; The following is the paragraph to which the Saints
objected.&nbsp; It occurs in an "Artemus Ward" paper on Brigham
Young, written some years ago:</p>
<p>"I girded up my Lions and fled the Seen.&nbsp; I packt up my
duds and left Salt Lake, which is a 2nd Soddum and Germorer,
inhabited by as theavin' &amp; onprincipled a set of retchis as
ever drew Breth in eny spot on the Globe."</p>
<p>I had forgotten all about this, and as Elder Stenhouse read it
to me "my feelings may be better imagined than described," to use
language I think I have heard before.&nbsp; I pleaded, however,
that it was a purely burlesque sketch, and that this strong
paragraph should not be interpreted literally at all. The Elder
didn't seem to see it in that light, but we parted pleasantly.</p>

<p>THE MOUNTAIN FEVER.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>I go back to my hotel and go to bed, and I do not get up again
for two weary weeks.&nbsp; I have the mountain fever (so called in
Utah, though it closely resembles the old-style typhus) and my case
is pronounced dangerous.&nbsp; I don't regard it so.&nbsp; I don't,
in fact, regard anything.&nbsp; I am all right,
<i>myself</i>.&nbsp; My poor Hingston shakes his head sadly, and
Dr. Williamson, from Camp Douglas, pours all kinds of bitter stuff
down my throat.&nbsp; I drink his health in a dose of the cheerful
beverage known as jalap, and thresh the sheets with my hot
hands.&nbsp; I address large assemblages, who have somehow got into
my room, and I charge Dr. Williamson with the murder of Luce, and
Mr. Irwin, the actor, with the murder of Shakspeare.&nbsp; I have a
lucid spell now and then, in one of which James Townsend, the
landlord, enters.&nbsp; He whispers, but I hear what he says far
too distinctly: "This man can have anything and everything he
wants; but I'm no hand for a sick room.&nbsp; <i>I never could see
anybody die.</i> "</p>
<p>That was cheering, I thought.&nbsp; The noble Californian,
Jerome Davis&mdash;he of the celebrated ranch&mdash;sticks by me
like a twin brother, although I fear that in my hot frenzy I more
than once anathematised his kindly eyes.&nbsp; Nursers and
watchers, Gentile and Mormon, volunteer their services in hoops and
rare wines are sent to me from all over the city, which, if I can't
drink, the venerable and excellent Thomas can, easy.</p>
<p>I lay there in this wild, broiling way for nearly two weeks,
when one morning I woke up with my head clear and an immense
plaster on my stomach.&nbsp; The plaster had <i>operated</i>.&nbsp;
I was so raw that I could by no means say to Dr. Williamson, "Well
done, thou good and faithful servant".&nbsp; I wished he had lathed
me before he plastered me.&nbsp; I was fearfully weak.&nbsp; I was
frightfully thin.&nbsp; With either one of my legs you could have
cleaned the stem of a meerschaum pipe.&nbsp; My backbone had the
appearance of a clothesline with a quantity of English walnuts
strung upon it.&nbsp; My face was almost gone.&nbsp; My nose was so
sharp that I didn't dare stick it into other people's business for
fear it would stay there.&nbsp; But by borrowing my agent's
overcoat I succeeded in producing a shadow.</p>
<p>I have been looking at Zion all day, and my feet are sore and my
legs are weary.&nbsp; I go back to the Salt Lake House and have a
talk with landlord Townsend about the State of Maine.&nbsp; He came
from that bleak region, having skinned his infantile eyes in York
county.&nbsp; He was at Nauvoo, and was forced to sell his entire
property there for 50 dollars.&nbsp; He has thrived in Utah,
however, and is much thought of by the Church.&nbsp; He is an
Elder, and preaches occasionally.&nbsp; He has only two
wives.&nbsp; I hear lately that he has sold his property for 25,000
dollars to Brigham Young, and gone to England to make
converts.&nbsp; How impressive he may be as an expounder of the
Mormon gospel, I don't know.&nbsp; His beefsteaks and chicken-pies,
however, were first-rate.&nbsp; James and I talk about Maine, and
cordially agree that so far as pine boards and horse-mackerel are
concerned, it is equalled by few and excelled by none.&nbsp; There
is no place like home, as Clara, the Maid of Milan, very justly
observes; and while J. Townsend would be unhappy in Maine, his
heart evidently beats back there now and then.</p>
<p>I heard the love of home oddly illustrated in Oregon, one night,
in a country bar-room.&nbsp; Some well-dressed men, in a state of
strong drink, were boasting of their respective places of
nativity.</p>
<p>"I," said one, "was born in Mississippi, where the sun ever
shines and the magnolias bloom all the happy year round."</p>
<p>"And I," said another, "was born in Kentucky&mdash;Kentucky, the
home of impassioned oratory: the home of Clay, the State of
splendid women, of gallant men!"</p>
<p>"And I," said another, "was born in Virginia, the home of
Washington: the birthplace of statesmen: the State of chivalric
deeds and noble hospitality!"</p>
<p>"And I," said a yellow-haired and sallow-faced man, who was not
of this party at all, and who had been quietly smoking a short
black pipe by the fire during their magnificent
conversation&mdash;"and I was born in the garden-spot of
America."</p>
<p>"Where is that?" they said.</p>
<p>"SKEOUHEGAN, MAINE!" he replied; "kin I sell you a razor
strop?"</p>

<p>"I AM HERE."</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>There is no mistake about that, and there is a good prospect of
my staying here for some time to come.&nbsp; The snow is deep on
the ground, and more is falling.</p>
<p>The Doctor looks glum, and speaks of his ill-starred countryman,
of Sir. J. Franklin, who went to the Arctic once too much.</p>
<p>A good thing happened down here the other day, said a miner from
New Hampshire to me.&nbsp; "A man of Boston dressin' went through
there, and at one of the stations there wasn't any mules.&nbsp;
Says the man who was fixed out to kill in his Boston dressin',
'Where's them mules?'&nbsp; Says the driver, 'Them mules is into
the sage brush.&nbsp; You go catch 'em&mdash;that's wot <i>you</i>
do.'&nbsp; Says the man of Boston dressin', 'Oh no!'&nbsp; Says the
driver! 'Oh, yes!'and he took his long coach-whip and licked the
man of Boston dressin' till he went and caught them mules.&nbsp;
How does that strike you for a joke?"</p>
<p>It didn't strike me as much of a joke to pay a hundred and
seventy-five dollars in gold fare, and then be horse-whipped by
stage-drivers, for declining to chase mules.&nbsp; But people's
ideas of humor differ in regard to shrewdness which "reminds me of
a little story."</p>
<p>Sitting in a New England country store one day I overheard the
following dialogue between two brothers:</p>
<p>"Say, Bill, wot you done with that air sorrel mare of
yourn?"</p>
<p>"Sold her," said William, with a smile of satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Wot'd you git?"</p>
<p>"Hund'd an' fifty dollars, cash deown!"</p>
<p>"Show!&nbsp; Hund'd an' fifty for that kickin' spavin'd
critter!&nbsp; Who'd you sell her to?"</p>
<p>"Sold her to mother!"</p>
<p>"Wot!" exclaimed brother No. 1, "did you railly sell that
kickin' spavin'd critter to mother?&nbsp; Wall, you <i>air</i> a
shrewd one!"</p>

</center>
<center>
<p>BRIGHAM YOUNG.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Brigham Young sends word I may see him tomorrow.&nbsp; So I go
to bed singing the popular Mormon hymn:</p>
<p>At two o'clock the next afternoon Mr. Hiram B. Clawson, Brigham
Young's son-in-law and chief business manager, calls for me with
the Prophet's private sleigh, and we start for that distinguished
person's block.</p>
<p>I am shown into the Prophet's chief office.&nbsp; He comes
forward, greets me cordially, and introduces me to several
influential Mormons who are present.</p>
<p>Brigham Young is 62 years old, of medium height, and with sandy
hair and whiskers.&nbsp; An active, iron man, with a clear sharp
eye.&nbsp; A man of consummate shrewdness&mdash;of great executive
ability.&nbsp; He was born in the State of Vermont, and so by the
way was Heber C. Kimball, who will wear the Mormon Belt when
Brigham leaves the ring.</p>
<p>Brigham Young is a man of great natural ability.&nbsp; If you
ask me, How pious is he? I treat it as a conundrum, and give it
up.&nbsp; Personally he treated me with marked kindness throughout
my sojourn in Utah.</p>
<p>His power in Utah is quite as absolute as that of any living
sovereign, yet he uses it with such consummate shrewdness that his
people are passionately devoted to him.</p>
<p>He was an Elder at the first formal Mormon "stake" in this
country, at Kirtland, Ohio, and went to Nauvoo with Joseph
Smith.&nbsp; That distinguished Mormon handed his mantle and the
Prophet business over to Brigham when he died at Nauvoo.</p>
<p>Smith did a more flourishing business in the Prophet line than
B.Y. does.&nbsp; Smith used to have his little Revelation almost
every day&mdash;sometimes two before dinner.&nbsp; B.Y. only takes
one once in a while.</p>
<p>The gateway of his block is surmounted by a brass American
eagle, and they say ("they say" here means anti-Mormons) that he
receives his spiritual dispatches through this piece of patriotic
poultry.&nbsp; They also say that he receives revelations from a
stuffed white calf that is trimmed with red ribbons and kept in an
iron box.&nbsp; I don't suppose these things are true.&nbsp; Rumor
says that when the Lion House was ready to be shingled, Brigham
received a message from the Lord stating that the carpenters must
all take hold and shingle it, and not charge a red cent for their
services.&nbsp; Such carpenters as refused to shingle would go to
hell, and no postponement on account of the weather.&nbsp; They say
that Brigham, whenever a train of emigrants arrives in Salt Lake
City, orders all the women to march up and down before his block,
while he stands on the portico of the Lion House and gobbles up the
prettiest ones.</p>
<p>He is an immensely wealthy man.&nbsp; His wealth is variously
estimated at from ten to twenty millions of dollars.&nbsp; He owns
saw mills, grist mills, woollen factories, brass and iron
foundries, farms, brick-yards, &amp;c., and superintends them all
in person.&nbsp; A man in Utah individually owns what he grows and
makes, with the exception of a one-tenth part: that must go to the
Church; and Brigham Young, as the first President, is the Church's
treasurer.&nbsp; Gentiles, of course, say that he abuses this blind
confidence of his people, and speculates with their money, and
absorbs the interest if he doesn't the principle.&nbsp; The Mormons
deny this, and say that whatever of their money he does use is for
the good of the Church; that he defrays the expenses of emigrants
from far over the seas; that he is foremost in all local
enterprises tending to develop the resources of the territory, an
that, in short, he is incapable of wrong in any shape.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know how many wives Brigham Young has.&nbsp;
Some set the number as high as eighty, in which case his children
must be too numerous to mention.&nbsp; Each wife has a room to
herself.&nbsp; These rooms are large and airy, and I suppose they
are supplied with all the modern improvements.&nbsp; But never
having been invited to visit them I can't speak very definitely
about this.&nbsp; When I left the Prophet he shook me cordially by
the hand, and invited me to call again.&nbsp; This was flattering,
because if he dislikes a man at the first interview he never sees
him again.&nbsp; He made no allusion to the "letter" I had written
about his community.&nbsp; Outside guards were pacing up and down
before the gateway, but they smiled upon me sweetly.&nbsp; The
veranda was crowded with Gentile miners, who seemed to be surprised
that I didn't return in a wooden overcoat, with my throat neatly
laid open from ear to ear.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>I go to the Theatre to-night.&nbsp; I was an actor once,
myself.&nbsp; I supported Edwin Forrest at a theatre in
Philadelphia.&nbsp; I played a pantomimic part.&nbsp; I removed the
chairs between scenes, and I did it so neatly that Mr. F. said I
would make a cabinet-maker if I "applied" myself.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>The parquette of the theatre is occupied exclusively by the
Mormons and their wives and children.&nbsp; They wouldn't let a
Gentile in there any more than they would a serpent.&nbsp; In the
side seats are those of President Young's wives who go the play,
and a large and varied assortment of children.&nbsp; It is an odd
sight to see a jovial old Mormon file down the parquette aisle with
ten or twenty robust wives at his heels.&nbsp; Yet this spectacle
may be witnessed every night the theatre is opened.&nbsp; The dress
circle is chiefly occupied by the officers from Camp Douglas and
the Gentile Merchants.&nbsp; The upper circles are filled by the
private soldiers and Mormon boys.&nbsp; I feel bound to say that a
Mormon audience is quite as appreciative as any other kind of an
audience.&nbsp; They prefer comedy to tragedy. Sentimental plays,
for obvious reasons, are unpopular with them.&nbsp; It will be
remembered that when C. Melnotte, in the Lady of Lyons, comes home
from the wars, he folds Pauline to his heaving heart and makes
several remarks of an impassioned and slobbering character.&nbsp;
One night when the Lady of Lyons was produced here, an aged Mormon
arose and went out with his twenty-four wives, angrily stating that
he wouldn't sit and see a play where a man made such a <i>cussed
fuss over one woman</i>.</p>
<p>Brigham Young usually sits in the middle of the parquette, in a
rocking-chair, and with his hat on.&nbsp; He does not escort his
wives to the theatre.&nbsp; They go alone.&nbsp; When the play
drags he either falls into a tranquil sleep or walks out.&nbsp; He
wears in winter time a green wrapper, and his hat in the style
introduced into this country by Louis Kossuth, Esq. the liberator
of Hungaria.&nbsp; I invested a dollar in the liberty of Hungaria
nearly fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>I lectured here, and I can only say that I was never listened to
more kindly than I was by this audience.</p>

<p>HURRAH FOR THE ROAD!</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>TIME, Wednesday afternoon, February 10.&nbsp; The Overland
Stage, Mr. William Glover on the box, stands before the veranda of
the Salt Lake House.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We go away on wheels, but the deep snow compels us to substitute
runners twelve miles out.</p>
<p>There are four passengers of us.&nbsp; We pierce the Wahsatch
mountains by Parley's canyon.</p>
<p>We reach Weber station, thirty miles from Salt Lake City and
wildly situated at the foot of the grand Echo Canyon, at 3 o'clock
the following morning.&nbsp; We remain over a day here with James
Bromley, agent of the Overland Stage line, and who is better known
on the plains than Shakspeare is; although Shakspeare has done a
good deal for the stage.&nbsp; James Bromley has seen the Overland
line grow up from its ponyicy; and as Fitz-Green Halleck happily
observes, none know him <i>but to like his style</i>.&nbsp; He was
intended for an agent.&nbsp; In his infancy he used to lisp the
refrain,<br /></p>
<center>
<p>"I want to be an
agent,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
And with the agents stand."</p>
</center>
<p>Forward to Fort Bridger, in an open sleigh.&nbsp; Night clear,
cold, and moonlit.&nbsp; Driver Mr. Samuel Smart.&nbsp; Through
Echo Canyon to Hanging Rock Station.&nbsp; The snow is very deep,
there is no path, and we literally shovel our way to Robert
Pollock's station, which we achieve in the Course of Time.&nbsp;
Mr. P. gets up and kindles a fire, and a snowy nightcap and a pair
of very bright black eyes beam upon us from the bed.&nbsp; That is
Mrs. Robert Pollock.&nbsp; The log cabin is a comfortable
one.&nbsp; I make coffee in my French coffee-pot, and let loose
some of the roast chickens in my basket.&nbsp; Mrs. Pollock tells
me where I can find cream for the coffee, and cups and saucers for
the same, and appears so kind, that I regret our stay is so limited
that we can't see more of her.</p>
<p>On to Yellow Creek Station.&nbsp; Then Needle Rock&mdash;a
desolate hut on the Desert, house and barn in one building.&nbsp;
The station-keeper is a miserable, toothless wretch, with shaggy
yellow hair, but says he's going to get married.&nbsp; I think I
see him.</p>
<p>Pass Quaking Asp Springs and Muddy to Fort Bridger.&nbsp; Here
are a group of white buildings, built round a plaza, across the
middle of which runs a creek.</p>
<p>We are on the road again, Sunday the 14th, with a driver of the
highly floral name of Primrose.&nbsp; At 7 the next morning we
reach Green River Station, and enter Idaho Territory.&nbsp; This is
the Bitter Creek division of the Overland route, of which we had
heard so many unfavorable stories.&nbsp; The division is really
well managed by Mr. Stewart, though the country through which it
stretches is the most wretched I ever saw.&nbsp; The water is
liquid alkali, and the roads are soft sand.&nbsp; The snow is gone
now, and the dust is thick and blinding.&nbsp; So drearily, wearily
we drag onward.</p>
<p>We reach the summit of the Rocky Mountains at midnight on the
17th.&nbsp; The climate changes suddenly, and the cold is
intense.&nbsp; We resume runners, have a breakdown, and are forced
to walk four miles.</p>
<p>I remember that one of the numerous reasons urged in favor of
General Fremont's election to the Presidency in 1856 was his
finding the path across the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; I wrung my
frostbitten hands on that dreadful night, and declared that for me
to deliberately go over that path in mid-winter was a sufficient
reason for my election to any lunatic asylum, by an overwhelming
vote.</p>
<p>Another sensation.&nbsp; Not comic this time.&nbsp; One of our
passengers, a fair-haired German boy, whose sweet ways had quite
won us all, sank on the snow, and said&mdash;Let me sleep.&nbsp; We
knew only too well what that meant, and tried hard to rouse
him.&nbsp; It was in vain.&nbsp; Let me sleep, he said.&nbsp; And
so in the cold starlight he died.&nbsp; We took him up tenderly
from the snow, and bore him to the sleigh that awaited us by the
roadside, some two miles away.&nbsp; The new moon was shining now,
and the smile on the sweet white face told how painlessly the poor
boy had died.&nbsp; No one knew him.&nbsp; He was from the Bannock
mines, was ill-clad, had no baggage or money, and his fare was paid
to Denver.&nbsp; He had said that he was going back to
Germany.&nbsp; That was all we knew.&nbsp; So at sunrise the next
morning we buried him at the foot of the grand mountains that are
snow-covered and icy all the year round, far away from the
Faderland, where it may be, some poor mother is crying for her
darling who will not come.</p>
<p>We strike the North Platte on the 18th.</p>
<p>At Elk Mountain we encounter a religious driver named Edward
Whitney, who never swears at the mules.&nbsp; This has made him
distinguished all over the plains.&nbsp; This pious driver tried to
convert the Doctor, but I am mortified to say that his efforts were
not crowned with success, Fort Halleck is a mile from Elk, and here
are some troops of the Ohio 11th regiment, under the command of
Major Thomas L. Mackey.</p>
<p>On the 20th we reach Rocky Thomas's justly celebrated station at
5 in the morning, and have a breakfast of hashed black-tailed deer,
antelope steaks, ham, boiled bear, honey, eggs, coffee, tea, and
cream.&nbsp; That was the squarest meal on the road except at
Weber.</p>
<p>To Virginia Dale.&nbsp; Weather clear and bright.&nbsp; Virginia
Dale is a pretty spot, as it ought to be with such a pretty name;
but I treated with no little scorn the advice of a hunter I met
there, who told me to give up "literatoor," form a matrimonial
alliance with some squaws, and "settle down thar."</p>
<p>Bannock on the brain!&nbsp; That is what is the matter
now.&nbsp; Wagon-load after wagon-load of emigrants, bound to the
new Idaho gold regions, meet us every hour.&nbsp; Canvas-covered
and drawn for the most part by fine large mules, they make a
pleasant panorama, as they stretch slowly over the plains and
uplands.&nbsp; We strike the South Platte Sunday, 21st, and
breakfast at Latham, a station of one-horse proportions.&nbsp; We
are now in Colorado ("Pike's Peak"), and we diverge from the main
route here and visit the flourishing and beautiful city of Denver,
where I lecture.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/17.gif" alt=
"picture of Indian plowing" /> We go to the mountains from Denver,
visiting the celebrated gold-mining towns of Black Hawk and Central
ity.&nbsp; I leave this queen of all the territories, quite firmly
believing that its future is to be no less brilliant than its past
has been.</p>
<p>Back to Latham again over a marshy road, and on to Nebraska by
the main stage-line.</p>
<p>We reach Julesberg, Colorado, the 1st of March.&nbsp; We are in
the country of the Sioux Indians now, and encounter them by the
hundred.&nbsp; A Chief offers to sell me his daughter (a fair young
Indian maiden) for six dollars and two quarts of whisky.&nbsp; I
decline to trade.</p>
<p><i>Kansas</i>, 105 miles from Atchison.&nbsp; Atchison! No
traveller by sea ever longed to set his foot on shore as we longed
to reach the end of our dreary coach-ride over the wildest part of
the whole continent.&nbsp; How we talked Atchison, and dreamed
Atchison, for the next fifty hours! Atchison, I shall always love
you.&nbsp; You were evidently mistaken, Atchison, when you told me
that in case I "lectured" there, immense crowds would throng to the
hall; but you are very dear to me.&nbsp; Let me kiss you for your
maternal parent!</p>
<p>We are passing through the reservation of the Otoe Indians, who
long ago washed the war-paint from their faces, buried the
tomahawk, and settled down into quiet, prosperous
farmers.<br /></p>
<center>_______________</center>
<p>We rattle leisurely into Atchison on a Sunday evening.&nbsp;
Lights gleam in the windows of milk-white churches, and they tell
us, far better than anything else could, that we are back to
civilization again.</p>

</center>
<center>
<p>VERY MUCH MARRIED.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Are the Mormon women happy?</p>
<p>I give it up.&nbsp; I don't know.</p>
<p>Igive it up.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Apparently, the Mormon
women are happy.&nbsp; I saw them at their best, of course&mdash;at
balls, tea-parties and the like.&nbsp; They were like other women
as far as my observation extended.&nbsp; They were hooped, and
furbelowed, and shod, and white-collard, and bejewelled; and like
women all over the world, they were softer-eyed and kinder-hearted
than men can ever hope to be.</p>
<p>The Mormon girl is reared to believe that the plurality-wife
system as it is delicately called here is strictly right; and in
linking her destiny with a man who has twelve wives, she
undoubtedly considers she is doing her duty.&nbsp; She loves the
man, probably, for I think it is not true, as so many writers have
stated, that girls are forced to marry whomsoever "the Church" may
dictate.&nbsp; Some parents no doubt advise, connive, threaten, and
in aggravated cases incarcerate here, as some parents have always
done elsewhere, and always will do as long as petticoats continue
to be an institution.</p>
<p>How these dozen or twenty wives get along without heart-burnings
and hairpullings I can't see.</p>
<p>There are instances on record, you know, where a man don't live
in a state of uninterrupted bliss with <i>one</i> wife.&nbsp; And
to say that a man can possess twenty wives without having his
special favorite, or favorites, is to say that he is an angel in
boots&mdash;which is something I have never been introduced
to.&nbsp; You never saw an angel with a Beard, although you may
have seen the Bearded Woman.</p>
<p>The Mormon woman is early taught that man, being created in the
image of the Saviour, is far more godly than she can ever be, and
that for her to seek to monopolize his affections is a species of
rank sin.&nbsp; So she shares his affections with five or six or
twenty other women, as the case may be.</p>
<p>A man must be amply able to support a number of wives before he
can take them.&nbsp; Hence, perhaps, it is that so many old chaps
in Utah have young and blooming wives in their seraglios, and so
many young men have only one.</p>
<p>I had a man pointed out to me who married an entire
family.&nbsp; He had originally intended to marry Jane, but Jane
did not want to leave her widowed mother.&nbsp; The other three
sisters were not in the matrimonial market for the same reason; so
this gallant man married the whole crowd, including the girl's
grandmother, who had lost all her teeth, and had to be fed with a
spoon.&nbsp; The family were in indigent circumstances, and they
could not but congratulate themselves on securing a wealthy
husband.&nbsp; It seemed to affect the grandmother deeply, for the
first words she said on reaching her new home were: "Now, thank
God!&nbsp; I shall have my gruel reg'lar!"</p>
<p>The name of Joseph Smith is worshipped in Utah; and, "they say,"
that although he had been dead a good many years, he still keeps on
marrying women by proxy.&nbsp; He "reveals" who shall act as his
earthly agent in this matter, and the agent faithfully executes the
defunct Prophet's commands.</p>
<p>I have somewhere stated that Brigham Young is said to have
eighty wives.&nbsp; I hardly think he has so many.&nbsp; Mr. Hyde,
the backslider, says in his book that "Brigham always sleeps by
himself, in a little chamber behind his office;" and if he has
eighty wives I don't blame him.&nbsp; He must be bewildered.&nbsp;
I know very well that if I had eighty wives of my bosom I should be
confused, and shouldn't sleep anywhere.&nbsp; I undertook to count
the long stockings, on the clothes-line, in his back yard one day,
and I used up the multiplication table in less than half an
hour.&nbsp; It made me dizzy&mdash;it did!</p>
<p>In this book I am writing chiefly of what I saw, and to
elaborately denounce, at this late day, a system we all know must
be wildly wrong, would be simply to impeach the intelligence of the
readers of this book.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL IN LONDON.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH: My dear Sir,&mdash;You prob'ly didn't meet my uncle
Wilyim when he was on these shores.&nbsp; I jedge so from the fack
that his pursoots wasn't litrary.&nbsp; Commerce, which it has been
trooly observed by a statesman, or somebody, is the foundation
stone onto which a nation's greatness rests, glorious Commerce was
Uncle Wilyim's fort.&nbsp; He sold soap.&nbsp; It smelt pretty, and
redily commanded two pents a cake.&nbsp; I'm the only litrary man
in our fam'ly.&nbsp; It is troo, I once had a dear cuzzun who wrote
22 verses onto "A Child who nearly Died of the Measles, O!" but as
he injoodiciously introjudiced a chorious at the end of each
stansy, the parrents didn't like it at all.&nbsp; The father in
particler wept afresh, assaulted my cuzzun, and said he never felt
so ridicklus in his intire life.&nbsp; The onhappy result was that
my cuzzun abandined poetry forever, and went back to shoemakin, a
shattered man.</p>
<p>My Uncle Wilyim disposed of his soap, and returned to his nativ
land with a very exolted opinyon of the British public.&nbsp; "It
is a edycated community," said he; "they're a intellectooal
peple.&nbsp; In one small village alone I sold 50 cakes of soap,
incloodin barronial halls, where they offered me a ducal coronet,
but I said no&mdash;give it to the poor." This was the way Uncle
Wilyim went on.&nbsp; He told us, however, some stories that was
rather too much to be easily swallerd.&nbsp; In fack, my Uncle
Wilyim was not a emblem of trooth.&nbsp; He retired some years ago
on a hansum comptency derived from the insurance-money he received
on a rather shaky skooner he owned, and which turned up while lyin
at a wharf one night, the cargo havin fortnitly been removed the
day afore the disastriss calamty occurd.&nbsp; Uncle Wilyim said it
was one of the most sing'ler things he ever heard of; and, after
collectin the insurance money, he bust into a flood of tears, and
retired to his farm in Pennsylvany.&nbsp; He was my uncle by
marriage only.&nbsp; I do not say that he wasn't a honest
man.&nbsp; I simply say that if you have a uncle, and bitter
experunce tells you it is more profitable in a pecoonery pint of
view to put pewter spoons instid of silver ones onto the table when
that uncle dines with you in a frenly way&mdash;I simply say, there
is sumthun wrong in our social sistim, which calls loudly for
reform.</p>

"picture of Artemus shaking hands with Mr. Punch" /> I 'rived on
these shores at Liverpool, and proceeded at once to London.&nbsp; I
stopt at the Washington Hotel in Liverpool, because it was named
after a countryman of mine who didn't get his living by makin'
mistakes, and whose mem'ry is dear to civilized peple all over the
world, because he was gentle and good as well as trooly
great.&nbsp; We read in Histry of any number of great individooals,
but how few of 'em, alars! should we want to take home to supper
with us!&nbsp; Among others, I would call your attention to
Alexander the Great, who conkerd the world, and wept because he
couldn't do it sum more, and then took to gin-and-seltzer, gettin'
tight every day afore dinner with the most disgustin' reg'larity,
causin' his parunts to regret they hadn't 'prenticed him in his
early youth to a biskit-baker, or some other occupation of a
peaceful and quiet character.&nbsp; I say, therefore, to the great
men now livin; (you could put 'em all into Hyde Park, by the way,
and still leave room for a large and respectable concourse of
rioters)&mdash;be good.&nbsp; I say to that gifted but bald-heded
Prooshun, Bismarck, be good and gentle in your hour of
triump.&nbsp; <i>I</i> always am.&nbsp; I admit that our lines is
different, Bismarck's and mine; but the same glo'rus principle is
involved, I am a exhibiter of startlin' curiositys, wax works,
snaix, etsetry ("either of whom," as a American statesman whose
name I ain't at liberty to mention for perlitical resins, as he
expecks to be a candidate for a prom'nent offiss, and hence doesn't
wish to excite the rage and jelisy of other showmen&mdash;"either
of whom is wuth dubble the price of admission"); I say I am an
exhibiter of startlin curiositys, and I also have my hours of
triump, but I try to be good in 'em.&nbsp; If you say, "Ah, yes,
but also your hours of grief and misfortin;" I answer, it is troo,
and you prob'ly refer to the circumstans of my hirin' a young man
of dissypated habits to fix hisself up as A real Cannibal from New
Zeelan, and when I was simply tellin the audience that he was the
most feroshos Cannibal of his tribe, and that, alone and
unassisted, he had et sev'ril of our fellow countrymen, and that he
had at one time even contemplated eatin his Uncle Thomas on his
mother's side, as well as other near and dear relatives,&mdash;when
I was makin' these simple statements the mis'ble young man said I
was a lyer, and knockt me off the platform.&nbsp; Not quite
satisfied with this, he cum and trod hevly on me, and as he was a
very muscular person and wore remarkable thick boots, I knew at
once that a canary bird wasn't walkin' over me.</p>
<p>I admit that my ambition overlept herself in this instuns, and
I've been very careful ever since to deal square with the
public.&nbsp; If I was the public I should insist on squareness,
tho' I shouldn't do as a portion of my audience did on the occasion
jest mentioned, which they was employed in sum naberin' coal
mines.&nbsp; "As you hain't got no more Cannybals to show us, old
man," said one of 'em, who seemed to be a kind of leader among
'em&mdash;a tall dis'greeble skoundril&mdash;"as you seem to be out
of Cannybals, we'll sorter look round here and fix things.&nbsp;
Them wax figgers of yours want washin'.&nbsp; There's Napoleon
Bonyparte and Julius Caesar&mdash;they must have a bath," with
which coarse and brutal remark he imitated the shrill war-hoop of
the western savige, and, assisted by his infamus coal-heavin
companyins, he threw all my wax-work into the river, and let my
wild bears loose to pray on a peaceful and inoffensive
agricultooral community.</p>
<p>Leavin Liverpool (I'm goin' back there, tho&mdash;I want to see
the Docks, which I heard spoken of at least once while I was there)
I cum to London in a 1st class car, passin' the time very agreeable
in discussin, with a countryman of mine, the celebrated
Schleswig-Holstein question.&nbsp; We took that int'resting
question up and carefully traced it from the time it commenced
being so, down to the present day, when my countryman, at the close
of a four hours' annymated debate, said he didn't know anything
about it himself, and he wanted to know if I did.&nbsp; I told him
that I did not.&nbsp; He's at Ramsgate now, and I am to write him
when I feel like givin him two days in which to discuss the
question of negro slavery in America.&nbsp; But now I do not feel
like it.</p>
<p>London at last, and I'm stoppin at the Greenlion tavern.&nbsp; I
like the lan'lord very much indeed.&nbsp; He had fallen into a few
triflin errers in regard to America&mdash;he was under the
impression, for instance, that we et hay over there, and had horns
growin out of the back part of our heads&mdash;but his chops and
beer is ekal to any I ever pertook.&nbsp; You must cum and see me
and bring the boys.&nbsp; I'm told that Garrick used to cum here,
but I'm growin skeptycal about Garrick's favorit taverns.&nbsp;
I've had over 500 public-houses pinted out to me where Garrick
went.&nbsp; I was indooced one night, by a seleck comp'ny of
Britons, to visit sum 25 public-houses, and they confidentially
told me that Garrick used to go to each one of 'em.&nbsp; Also, Dr.
Johnson.&nbsp; This won't do, you know.</p>
<p>May be I've rambled a bit in this communycation.&nbsp; I'll try
and be more collected in my next, and meanwhile, b'lieve
me,<br /></p>

</center>
<center>
<p>PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>You'll be glad to learn that I've made a good impression onto
the mind of the lan'lord of the Green Lion tavern.&nbsp; He made a
speech about me last night.&nbsp; Risin' in the bar he spoke as
follers, there bein over 20 individooals present:&nbsp; "This North
American has been a inmate of my 'ouse over two weeks, yit he
hasn't made no attempt to scalp any member of my fam'ly.&nbsp; He
hasn't broke no cups or sassers, or furnitur of any kind.&nbsp;
("Hear, hear.")&nbsp; I find I can trust him with lited
candles.&nbsp; He eats his wittles with a knife and a fork.&nbsp;
People of this kind should be encurridged.&nbsp; I purpose 'is
'elth!"&nbsp; ("Loud 'plaws.")</p>
<p>What could I do but modestly get up and express a fervint hope
that the Atlantic Cable would bind the two countries still more
closely together?&nbsp; The lan'lord said my speech was full of
orig'nality, but his idee was the old stage coach was more safer,
and he tho't peple would indors that opinyin in doo time.</p>
<p>I'm gettin' on exceedin' well in London.&nbsp; I see now,
however, that I made a mistake in orderin' my close afore I left
home.&nbsp; The trooth is the taler in our little villige owed me
for a pig and I didn't see any other way of gettin' my pay.&nbsp;
Ten years ago these close would no doubt have been fash'n'ble, and
perhaps they would be ekally sim'lar ten years hens.&nbsp; But now
they're diff'rently.&nbsp; The taler said he know'd they was all
right, because he had a brother in Wales who kept him informed
about London fashins reg'lar.&nbsp; This was a infamus
falsehood.&nbsp; But as the ballud says (which I heard a gen'l'man
in a new soot of black close and white kid gloves sing t'other
night), Never don't let us Despise a Man because he wears a Raggid
Coat!&nbsp; I don't know as we do, by the way, tho' we gen'rally
get out of his way pretty rapid; prob'ly on account of the pity
which tears our boosums for his onhappy condition.</p>
<p>This last remark is a sirkastic and witherin' thrust at them
blotid peple who live in gilded saloons.&nbsp; I tho't I'd explain
my meanin' to you.&nbsp; I frekently have to explain the meanin' of
my remarks.&nbsp; I know one man&mdash;and he's a man of varid
'complishments&mdash;who often reads my articles over 20 times
afore he can make anything of 'em at all.&nbsp; Our skoolmaster to
home says this is a pecoolerarity of geneyus.&nbsp; My wife says it
is a pecoolerarity of infernal nonsens.&nbsp; She's a exceedin'
practycal woman.&nbsp; I luv her muchly, however, and humer her
little ways.&nbsp; It's a recklis falshood that she henpecks me,
and the young man in our neighborhood who said to me one evenin',
as I was mistenin' my diafram with a gentle cocktail at the villige
tavun&mdash;who said to me in these very langwidge, "Go home, old
man, onless you desires to have another teapot throwd at you by
B.J.," probly regrets havin said so.</p>
<p>I said, "Betsy Jane is my wife's front name, gentle yooth, and I
permits no person to alood to her as B.J. outside of the family
circle, of which I am it principally myself.&nbsp; Your other
observations I scorn and disgust, and I must pollish you off."</p>
<p>He was a able-bodied young man, and, remoovin his coat, he
enquired if I wanted to be ground to powder?&nbsp; I said,
Yes:&nbsp; if there was a Powder-grindist handy, nothin would 'ford
me greater pleasure, when he struck me a painful blow into my right
eye, causin' me to make a rapid retreat into the fireplace.&nbsp; I
hadn't no idee that the enemy was so well organized.&nbsp; But I
rallied and went for him, in a rayther vigris style for my time of
life.&nbsp; His parunts lived near by, and I will simply state 15
minits had only elapst after the first act when he was carried home
on a shutter.&nbsp; His mama met the sollum procession at the door,
and after keerfully looking her orfspring over, she said:&nbsp; "My
son, I see how it is distinctually.&nbsp; You've been foolin' round
a Trashin Masheen.&nbsp; You went in at the place where they put
the grain in, cum out with the straw, and you got up into the
thingamyjig, and let the horses tred on you, didn't you, my
son?"&nbsp; The pen of no liven Orthur could describe that
disfortnit young man's sittywation more clearer.&nbsp; But I was
sorry for him, and I went and nussed him till he got well.&nbsp;
His reg'lar original father being absent to the war, I told him I'd
be a father to him myself.&nbsp; He smilt a sickly smile, and said
I'd already been wus than two fathers to him.</p>
<p>I will here obsarve that fitin orter be allus avided, excep in
extreem cases.&nbsp; My principle is, if a man smites me on the
right cheek I'll turn my left to him, prob'ly; but if he
insinooates that my gran'mother wasn't all right, I'll punch his
hed.&nbsp; But fitin is mis'ble bisniss, gen'rally speakin, and
whenever any enterprisin countryman of mine cums over here to scoop
up a Briton in the prize ring I'm allus excessively tickled when he
gets scooped hisself, which it is a sad fack has thus far been the
case&mdash;my only sorrer bein' that t'other feller wasn't scooped
likewise.&nbsp; It's diff'rently with scullin boats, which is a
manly sport, and I can only explain Mr. Hamil's resunt defeat in
this country on the grounds that he wasn't used to British
water.&nbsp; I hope this explanation will be entirely satisfact'ry
to all.</p>
<p>As I remarked afore, I'm gettin' on well.&nbsp; I'm aware that
I'm in the great metrop'lis of the world, and it doesn't make me
onhappy to admit the fack.&nbsp; A man is a ass who dispoots
it.&nbsp; That's all that ails <i>him</i>.&nbsp; I know there is
sum peple who cum over here and snap and snarl 'bout this and that:
I know one man who says it is a shame and a disgrace that St.
Paul's Church isn't a older edifiss; he says it should be years and
even ages older than it is; but I decline to hold myself
responsible for the conduck of this idyit simply because he's my
countryman.&nbsp; I spose every civ'lised land is endowed with its
full share of gibberin' idyits, and it can't be
helpt&mdash;leastways I can't think of any effectooal plan of
helpin' it.</p>
<p>I'm a little sorry you've got politics over here, but I shall
not diskuss 'em with nobody.&nbsp; Tear me to pieces with wild
omnibus hosses, and I won't diskuss 'em.&nbsp; I've had quite enuff
of 'em at home, thank you.&nbsp; I was at Birmingham t'other night,
and went to the great meetin' for a few minits.&nbsp; I hadn't been
in the hall long when a stern-lookin' artisan said to me:</p>
<p>"You ar from Wales!"</p>
<p>No, I told him I didn't think I was.&nbsp; A hidgyis tho't
flasht over me.&nbsp; It was of that onprincipled taler, and I
said, "Has my clothin' a Welchy appearance?"</p>
<p>"Not by no means," he answered, and then he said, "And what is
your opinyin of the present crisis?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't zackly know.&nbsp; Have you got it very
bad?"</p>
<p>He replied, "Sir, it is sweepin' England like the Cymoon of the
Desert!"</p>
<p>"Wall," I said, "let it sweep!"</p>
<p>He ceased me by the arm and said, "Let us glance at
hist'ry.&nbsp; It is now some two thousand years&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is it, indeed?" I replied.</p>
<p>"Listin!" he fiercely cried; "it is only a little over two
thousand years since&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, bother!" I remarkt, "let us go out and git some beer."</p>
<p>"No, Sir.&nbsp; I want no gross and sensual beer.&nbsp; I'll not
move from this spot till I can vote.&nbsp; Who ar you?"</p>
<p>I handed him my card, which in addition to my name, contains a
elabrit description of my show.&nbsp; "Now, Sir," I proudly said,
"you know me?"</p>
<p>"I sollumly swear," he sternly replied, "that I never heard of
you, or your show, in my life!"</p>
<p>"And this man," I cried bitterly, "calls hisself a intelligent
man, and thinks he orter be allowed to vote! What a holler
mockery!"</p>
<p>I've no objection to ev'ry intelligent man votin' if he wants
to.&nbsp; It's a pleasant amoosement, no doubt; but there is those
whose igrance is so dense and loathsum that they shouldn't be
trustid with a ballit any more'n one of my trained serpunts should
be trusted with a child to play with.</p>
<p>I went to the station with a view of returnin' to town on the
cars.</p>
<p>"This way, Sir," said the guard; "here you ar," and he pinted to
a first-class carriage, the sole ockepant of which was a rayther
prepossessin' female of about 30 summers.</p>
<p>"No, I thank you," I earnestly replied, "I prefer to
walk."<br /></p>

<p>THE GREEN LION AND OLIVER CROMWELL.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH: My Dear Sir,&mdash;It is now two weeks since a
rayther strange lookin man engaged 'partments at the Green
Lion.&nbsp; He stated he was from the celebrated United States, but
beyond this he said nothin.&nbsp; He seem'd to prefer
sollytood.&nbsp; He remained mostly in his room, and whenever he
did show hisself he walkt in a moody and morose manner in the
garding, with his hed bowed down and his arms foldid across his
brest.&nbsp; He reminded me sumwhat of the celebrated but onhappy
"Mr. Haller," in the cheerful play of "The Stranger."&nbsp; This
man puzzled me.&nbsp; I'd been puzzled afore several times, but
never so severally as now.&nbsp; Mine Ost of the Greenlion said I
must interregate this strange bein, who claimed to be my
countryman.</p>
<p>"He hasn't called for a drop of beer since he's been in this ere
Ouse," said the landlord.&nbsp; "I look to you," he added, "to
clear up this dark, this orful mistry!"</p>
<p>I wringed the lan'lord's honest hand, and told him to consider
the mistry cleared up.</p>
<p>I gained axes to the misterus bein's room, and by talkin sweet
to him for a few minits, I found out who he was.&nbsp; Then
returnin to the lan'lord, who was nervisly pacin up and down the
bar, I said,</p>
<p>"Sweet ROLANDO, don't tremble no more!&nbsp; I've torn the marsk
from the hawty stranger's face, and dived into the recesses of his
inmost sole! He's a Trans-Mejim."</p>
<p>I'd been to the Beefanham theatre the previs evenin, and probly
the drammer I saw affected me, because I'm not in the habit of goin
on as per above.&nbsp; I like the Beefanham theatre very much
indeed, because there a enthoosiastic lover of the theatre like
myself can unite the legitermit drammer with fish.&nbsp; Thus,
while your enrapterd soul drinks in the lorfty and noble sentences
of the gifted artists, you can eat a biled mack'ril jest as
comfor'bly as in your own house.&nbsp; I felt constrained, however,
to tell a fond mother who sot immegitly behind me, and who was
accompanied by a gin bottle, and a young infant&mdash;I felt
constrained to tell that mother, when her infant playfully mingled
a rayther oily mack'ril with the little hair which is left on my
vener'ble hed, that I had a bottle of scented hair oil at home,
which on the whole I tho't I preferred to that which her orfspring
was greasin me with.&nbsp; This riled the excellent feamale, and
she said:</p>
<p>"Git out!&nbsp; You never was a infank yourself, I spose!&nbsp;
Oh no!&nbsp; You was too good to be a infank, you was!&nbsp; You
slid into the world all ready grow'd, didn't you?&nbsp; Git
out!"</p>
<p>"No, Madam," I replied, "I too was once a infant!&nbsp; I was a
luvly child.&nbsp; People used to come in large and enthoosiastic
crowds from all parts of the country to see me, I was such a sweet
and intel'gent infant.&nbsp; The excitement was so intens, in fack,
that a extra hotel was startid in the town to accomodate the peple
who thronged to my cradle."&nbsp; Havin finished these troothful
statemints, I smilt sweetly on the worthy female.&nbsp; She
said:</p>
<p>"Drat you, what do you come a-chaffin me for?" and the estymible
woman was really gettin furis, when I mollyfied her by praisin her
child, and by axin pardin for all I'd said.</p>
<p>"This little gal," I observed, "this surprisingly lively gal
when&mdash;" the mother said,</p>
<p>"It's t'other sect is he, Sir:&nbsp; it's a boy."</p>
<p>"Wall," I said, "then this little boy, whose eye is like a eagle
a-soaring proudly in the azure sky, will some day be a man, if he
don't choke hisself to death in childhood's sunny hours with a
smelt or a bloater, or some other drefful calamity.&nbsp; How
surblime the tho't, my dear Madam, that this infant as you fondle
on your knee on this night, may grow up into a free and independent
citizen, whose vote will be worth from ten to fifteen pounds,
accordin as suffrage may range at that joyous perid!"</p>
<p>Let us now return, jentle reader, to the lan'lord of the Green
Lion, who we left in the bar in a state of anxiety and
perspire.&nbsp; Rubbin his hot face with a red handkercher, he
said, "Is the strange bein a American?"</p>
<p>"He is."</p>
<p>"A Gen'ral?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"A Colonial?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"A Majer?"</p>
<p>"Not a Majer."</p>
<p>"A Capting?"</p>
<p>"He is not."</p>
<p>"A leftenant?"</p>
<p>"Not even that."</p>
<p>"Then," said the lan'lord of the Green Lion, "you ar
deceeved!&nbsp; He is no countryman of yours."</p>
<p>"Why not?" I said.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/19.gif" alt=
"picture of Arttemus as Capting of the Home Guards" /> "I will tell
you, Sir," said the lan'lord.&nbsp; "My son-in-law is employed in a
bankin house where ev'ry American as comes to these shores goes to
git his drafts casht, and he says that not one has arrived on these
shores during the last 18 months as wasn't a Gen'ral, a Colonial, a
Majer, a Capting, or a leftenant!&nbsp; This man, as I said afore,
has deceeved you!&nbsp; He's a imposture!"</p>
<p>I reeled into a chair.&nbsp; For a minit I was speechlis.&nbsp;
At length I murmured, "Alars!&nbsp; I fear it is too troo!&nbsp;
Even I was a Capting of the Home Gards."</p>
<p>"To be sure," said the lan'lord; "you all do it over there."</p>
<p>"Wall," I said, "whatever nation this person belongs to, we may
as well go and hear him lectur this evenin.&nbsp; He is one of
these spirit fellers&mdash;he is a Trans-Mejim, and when he slings
himself into a trans-state he says the sperits of departed great
men talk through him.&nbsp; He says that to-night sev'ril em'nent
persons will speak through him&mdash;among others, Cromwell."</p>
<p>"And this Mr. Cromwell&mdash;is he dead?" said the lan'lord.</p>
<p>I told him that Oliver was no more.</p>
<p>"It's a umbug," said the lan'lord; to which I replied that we'd
best go and see, and we went.&nbsp; We was late, on account of the
lan'lord's extensiv acquaintans with the public house keepers along
the road, and the hall was some two miles distant, but we got there
at last.&nbsp; The hall was about half full, and the Mejim was just
then assumin' to be Benjamin Franklin, who was speakin about the
Atlantic Cable.</p>
<p>He said the Cable was really a merrytorious affair, and that
messiges could be sent to America, and there was no doubt about
their gettin there in the course of a week or two, which he said
was a beautiful idear, and much quicker than by steamer or
canal-boat.&nbsp; It struck me that if this was Franklin a
spiritooal life hadn't improved the old gentleman's intellecks
particly.</p>
<p>The audiens was mostly composed of rayther pale peple, whose
eyes I tho't rolled round in a somewhat wild manner.&nbsp; But they
was well-behaved, and the females kept saying, "How
beautiful!&nbsp; What a surblime thing it is," et cetry, et
cetry.&nbsp; Among the females was one who was a fair and rosy
young woman.&nbsp; She sot on the same seat we did, and the
lan'lord of the Green Lion, whose frekent intervoos with other
lan'lords that evenin had been too much for him, fastened his left
eye on the fair and rosy young person, and smilin lovinly upon her,
said:</p>
<p>"You may give me, my dear, four-penny-worth of gin&mdash;cold
gin.&nbsp; I take it cold, because&mdash;"</p>
<p>There was cries of "Silence!&nbsp; Shame!&nbsp; Put him
out!&nbsp; The Skoffer!"</p>
<p>"Ain't we at the Spotted Boar?" the lan'lord hoarsely
whispered.</p>
<p>"No," I answered.&nbsp; "It's another kind of bore.&nbsp;
Lis'en.&nbsp; Cromwell is goin' to speak through our inspired
fren', now."</p>
<p>"Is he?" said the lan'lord&mdash;"is he?&nbsp; Wall, I've suthin
to say, also.&nbsp; Was this Cromwell a licensed vittler?"</p>
<p>"Not that I ever heard," I anserd.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for that," said the lan'lord with a sigh, "but you
think he was a man who would wish to see licensed vittlers
respected in their rights?"</p>
<p>"No doubt."</p>
<p>"Wall," said the lan'lord, "jest you keep a eye on me."&nbsp;
Then risin to his feet he said, in somewhat husky yet tol'bly
distink voice, "Mr. Crumbwell!"</p>
<p>"Cromwell!" I cried.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Cromwell:&nbsp; that's the man I mean, Mr. Cromble!
won't you please advise that gen'l'man who you're talkin through;
won't you advise'im during your elekant speech to settle his bill
at my 'ouse tonight, Mr. Crumbles," said the lan'lord, glarin'
savigely round on the peple, "because if he don't there'll be a
punched 'ed to be seen at the Green Lion, where I don't want no
more of this everlastin nonsens.&nbsp; I'LL talk through 'im!
Here's a sperrit," said the lan'lord, a smile once more beamin on
his face, "which will talk through him like a Dutch father!&nbsp;
I'm the sperrit for you, young feller!"</p>
<p>"You're a helthy old sperret," I remarkt; and then I saw the
necessity of gettin him out of the hall.&nbsp; The wimin was yellin
and screaming, and the men was hollerin' perlice.&nbsp; A
perliceman really came and collerd my fat fren.</p>
<p>"It's only a fit, Sir Richard," I said.&nbsp; I always call the
perlice Sir Richard.&nbsp; It pleases them to think I'm the victim
of a deloosion; and they always treat me perlitely.&nbsp; This one
did, certainly, for he let us go.&nbsp; We saw no more of the
Trans-Mejim.</p>
<p>It's diffikilt, of course, to say how long these noosances will
be allowed to prowl round.&nbsp; I should say, however, if pressed
for a answer that they will prob'ly continner on jest about as long
as they can find peple to lis'en to 'em.&nbsp; Am I
right?<br /></p>

<p>Mr. Punch, My dear Sir,&mdash;I've been lingerin by the Tomb of

<p>It is a success.</p>
<p>I do not hes'tate to pronounce it as such.</p>
<p>You may make any use of this opinion that you see fit.&nbsp; If
you think its publication will subswerve the cause of litteraoor,
you may publicate it.</p>
<p>I told my wife Betsy when I left home that I should go to the
birthplace of the orthur of "Otheller" and other Plays.&nbsp; She
said that as long as I kept out of Newgate she didn't care where I
went.&nbsp; "But," I said, "don't you know he was the greatest Poit
that ever lived?&nbsp; Not one of these common poits, like that
young idyit who writes verses to our daughter, about the Roses as
growses, and the Breezes as blowses&mdash;but a Boss
Poit&mdash;also a philosopher, also a man who knew a great deal
about everything."</p>
<p>She was packing my things at the time, and the only answer she
made was to ask me if I was goin to carry both of my red flannel
night-caps.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I've been to Stratford onto the Avon, the Birthplace
of Shakspeare.&nbsp; Mr. S. is now no more.&nbsp; He's been dead
over three hundred (300) years.&nbsp; The peple of his native town
are justly proud of him.&nbsp; They cherish his mem'ry, and them as
sell pictures of his birthplace, &amp;c., make it prof'tible
cherishin it.&nbsp; Almost everybody buys a pictur to put into
their Albiom.</p>
<p>As I stood gazing on the spot where Shakspeare is s'posed to
have fell down on the ice and hurt hisself when a boy, (this spot
cannot be bought&mdash;the town authorities say it shall never be
taken from Stratford), I wondered if three hundred years hence
picturs of <i>my</i> birthplace will be in demand?&nbsp; Will the
peple of my native town be proud of me in three hundred
years?&nbsp; I guess they won't short of that time because they say
the fat man weighing 1000 pounds which I exhibited there was
stuffed out with pillers and cushions, which he said one very hot
day in July, "Oh bother, I can't stand this," and commenced pullin
the pillers out from under his weskit, and heavin 'em at the
audience.&nbsp; I never saw a man lose flesh so fast in my
life.&nbsp; The audience said I was a pretty man to come chiselin
my own townsmen in that way.&nbsp; I said, "Do not be angry,
feller-citizens.&nbsp; I exhibited him simply as a work of
art.&nbsp; I simply wished to show you that a man could grow fat
without the aid of cod-liver oil."&nbsp; But they wouldn't listen
to me.&nbsp; They are a low and grovelin set of peple, who excite a
feelin of loathin in every brest where lorfty emotions and original
idees have a bidin place.</p>
<p>I stopped at Leamington a few minits on my way to Stratford onto
the Avon, and a very beautiful town it is.&nbsp; I went into a shoe
shop to make a purchis, and as I entered I saw over the door those
dear familiar words, "By Appintment:&nbsp; H.R.H.;" and I said to
the man, "Squire, excuse me, but this is too much.&nbsp; I have
seen in London four hundred boot and shoe shops by
Appintment:&nbsp; H.R.H.; and now <i>you're</i> at it.&nbsp; It is
simply onpossible that the Prince can wear 400 pairs of
boots.&nbsp; Don't tell me," I said, in a voice choked with
emotion&mdash;"Oh, do not tell me that you also make boots for
him.&nbsp; Say slippers&mdash;say that you mend a boot now and then
for him; but do not tell me that you make 'em reg'lar for him."</p>
<p>The man smilt, and said I didn't understand these things.&nbsp;
He said I perhaps had not noticed in London that dealers in all
sorts of articles was By Appintment.&nbsp; I said, "Oh,
<i>hadn't</i> I?"&nbsp; Then a sudden thought flasht over me.&nbsp;
"I have it!" I said. "When the Prince walks through a street, he no
doubt looks at the shop windows."</p>
<p>The man said, "No doubt."</p>
<p>"And the enterprisin tradesman," I continnerd, "the moment the
Prince gets out of sight, rushes frantically and has a tin sign
painted, By Appintment, H.R.H.!&nbsp; It is a beautiful, a great
idee!"</p>
<p>I then bought a pair of shoe strings, and wringin the shopman's
honest hand, I started for the Tomb of Shakspeare in a hired
fly.&nbsp; It look't however more like a spider.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/20.gif" alt=
"picture of Ward at Shakespear's grave" /> "And this," I said, as I
stood in the old church-yard at Stratford, beside a Tombstone,
"this marks the spot where lies William W. Shakspeare.&nbsp; Alars!
and this is the spot where&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You've got the wrong grave," said a man&mdash;a worthy
villager: "Shakspeare is buried inside the church."</p>
<p>"Oh," I said, "a boy told me this was it."&nbsp; The boy larfed
and put the shillin I'd given him onto his left eye in a inglorious
manner, and commenced moving backwards towards the street.</p>
<p>I pursood and captered him, and after talking to him a spell in
a skarcastic stile, I let him went.</p>
<p>The old church was damp and chill.&nbsp; It was rainin.&nbsp;
The only persons there when I entered was a fine bluff old
gentleman who was talking in a excited manner to a fashnibly
dressed young man.</p>
<p>"No, Earnest Montresser," the old gentleman said, "it is idle to
pursoo this subjeck no further.&nbsp; You can never marry my
daughter.&nbsp; You were seen last Monday in Piccadilly without a
umbreller!&nbsp; I said then, as I say now, any young man as
venturs out in a uncertain climit like this without a umbreller,
lacks foresight, caution, strength of mind and stability; and he is
not a proper person to intrust a daughter's happiness to."</p>
<p>I slapt the old gentleman on the shoulder, and I said:&nbsp;
"You're right!&nbsp; You're one of those kind of men, you
are&mdash;"</p>
<p>He wheeled suddenly round, and in a indignant voice, said, "Go
way&mdash;go way!&nbsp; This is a privit intervoo."</p>
<p>I didn't stop to enrich the old gentleman's mind with my
conversation.&nbsp; I sort of inferred that he wasn't inclined to
listen to me, and so I went on.&nbsp; But he was right about the
umbreller.&nbsp; I'm really delighted with this grand old country,
"Mr. Punch," but you must admit that it does rain rayther
numerously here.&nbsp; Whether this is owing to a monerkal form of
gov'ment or not I leave all candid and onprejudiced persons to
say.</p>
<p>William Shakspeare was born in Stratford in 1564.&nbsp; All the
commentaters, Shaksperian scholars, etsetry, are agreed on this,
which is about the only thing they are agreed on in regard to him,
except that his mantle hasn't fallen onto any poet or dramatist
hard enough to hurt said poet or dramatist <i>much</i>.&nbsp; And
there is no doubt if these commentaters and persons continner
investigating Shakspeare's career, we shall not, in doo time, know
anything about it at all.</p>
<p>When a mere lad little William attended the Grammar School,
because, as he said, the Grammar School wouldn't attend him.&nbsp;
This remarkable remark, comin from one so young and inexperunced,
set peple to thinkin there might be somethin in this lad.&nbsp; He
subsequently wrote "Hamlet" and "George Barnwell."&nbsp; When his
kind teacher went to London to accept a position in the offices of
the Metropolitan Railway, little William was chosen by his fellow
pupils to deliver a farewell address.</p>
<p>"Go on, Sir," he said, "in a glorus career.&nbsp; Be like a
eagle, and soar and the soarer you get the more we shall all be
gratified!&nbsp; That's so."</p>
<p>My young readers, who wish to know about Shakspeare, better get
these vallyable remarks framed.</p>
<p>I returned to the hotel.&nbsp; Meetin a young married couple,
they asked me if I could direct them to the hotel which Washington
Irving used to keep?</p>
<p>"I've understood that he was onsuccessful as a lan'lord," said
the lady.</p>
<p>"We've understood," said the young man, "that he busted up."</p>
<p>I told 'em I was a stranger, and hurried away.&nbsp; They were
from my country, and ondoubtedly represented a thrifty Ile well
somewhere in Pennsylvany.&nbsp; It's a common thing, by the way,
for a old farmer in Pennsylvany to wake up some mornin' and find
ile squirtin all around his back yard.&nbsp; He sells out for
'normous price, and his children put on gorgeous harness and start
on a tower to astonish people.&nbsp; They succeed in doin it.&nbsp;
Meantime the Ile squirts and squirts, and Time rolls on.&nbsp; Let
it roll.</p>
<p>A very nice old town is Stratford, and a capital inn is the Red
Horse.&nbsp; Every admirer of the great S. must go there once
certinly; and to say one isn't a admirer of him, is equv'lent to
sayin one has jest about brains enough to become a efficient
tinker.</p>
<p>Some kind person has sent me Chawcer's "poems."&nbsp; Mr. C. had
talent, but he couldn't spel.&nbsp; No man has a right to be a
lit'rary man onless he knows how to spel.&nbsp; It is a pity that
Chawcer, who had geneyus, was so unedicated.&nbsp; He's the wuss
speller I know of.</p>
<p>I guess I'm through, and so I lay down the pen, which is more
mightier than the sword, but which I'm fraid would stand a rayther
slim chance beside the needle gun.</p>

<p>IS INTRODUCED AT THE CLUB.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH, My dear Sir,&mdash;It is seldim that the Commercial
relations between Great Britain and the United States is mar'd by
Games.</p>
<p>It is Commerce after all, which will keep the two countries
friendly to'ards each other rather than statesmen.</p>
<p>I look at your last Parliament, and I can't see that a single
speech was encored during the entire session.</p>
<p>Look at Congress&mdash;but no, I'd rather not look at
Congress.</p>
<p>Entertainin this great regard for Commerce, "whose sales whiten
every sea," as everybody happily observes every chance he gets, I
learn with disgust and surprise that a British subjeck bo't a
Barril of Apple Sass in America recently, and when he arrove home
he found under a few deloosiv layers of sass nothin but
sawdust.&nbsp; I should have instintly gone into the City and
called a meetin of the leadin commercial men to condemn and
repudiate, as a American, this gross frawd, if I hadn't learned at
the same time that the draft given by the British subjeck in
payment for this frawdylent sass was drawed onto a Bankin House in
London which doesn't have a existance, but far otherwise, and never
did.</p>
<p>There is those who larf at these things, but to me they merit
rebooks and frowns.</p>
<p>With the exception of my Uncle Wilyim&mdash;who, as I've before
stated, is a uncle by marrige only, who is a low cuss and filled
his coat pockets with pies and biled eggs at his weddin breakfast,
given to him by my father, and made the clergyman as united him a
present of my father's new overcoat, and when my father on
discoverin' it got in a rage and denounced him, Uncle Wilyim said
the old man (meanin my parent) hadn't any idee of first class
Humer!&mdash;with the exception of this wretched Uncle the
escutchin of my fam'ly has never been stained by Games.&nbsp; The
little harmless deceptions I resort to in my perfeshion I do not
call Games.&nbsp; They are sacrifisses to Art.</p>
<p>I come of a very clever fam'ly.</p>
<p>The Wards is a very clever fam'ly indeed.</p>
<p>I believe we are descendid from the Puritins, who nobly fled
from a land of despitism to a land of freedim, where they could not
only enjoy their own religion, but prevent everybody else from
enjoyin <i>his</i>.</p>
<p>As I said before, we are a very clever fam'ly.</p>
<p>I was strolling up Regent Street the other day, thinkin what a
clever fam'ly I come of, and looking at the gay shop-winders.&nbsp;
I've got some new close since you last saw me.&nbsp; I saw them
others wouldn't do.&nbsp; They carrid the observer too far back
into the dim vister of the past, and I gave 'em to a Orfun
Asylum.&nbsp; The close I wear now I bo't of Mr. Moses, in the
Commercial Road.&nbsp; They was expressly made, Mr. Moses inforemd
me, for a nobleman, but as they fitted him too muchly, partic'ly
the trows'rs (which is blue, with large red and white checks) he
had said:</p>
<p>"My dear feller, make me some more, only mind&mdash;be sure you
sell these to some genteel old feller."</p>
<p>I like to saunter thro' Regent Street.&nbsp; The shops are
pretty, and it does the old man's hart good to see the troops of
fine healthy girls which one may always see there at certain hours
in the afternoon, who don't spile their beauty by devourin cakes
and sugar things, as too many of the American and French lasses
do.&nbsp; It's a mistake about everybody being out of town, I
guess. Regent Street is full.&nbsp; I'm here; and as I said before,
I come of a very clever fam'ly.</p>
<p>As I was walkin along, amoosin myself by stickin my penknife
into the calves of the footmen who stood waitin by the
swell-coaches (not one of whom howled with angwish), I was accosted
by a man of about thirty-five summers, who said, "I have seen that
face somewheres afore!"</p>
<p>He was a little shabby in his wearin apparil.&nbsp; His coat was
one of those black, shiny garments, which you can always tell have
been burnished by adversity; but he was very gentlemanly.</p>
<p>"Was it in the Crimea, comrade?&nbsp; Yes, it was.&nbsp; It was
at the stormin of Sebastopol, where I had a narrow escape from
death, that we met."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I wasn't at Sebastopol; I escaped a fatal wound by
not bein there.&nbsp; It was a healthy old fortress," I added.</p>
<p>"It was.&nbsp; But it fell.&nbsp; It came down with a
crash."</p>
<p>"And plucky boys they was who brought her down," I added; "and
hurrah for 'em!"</p>
<p>The man graspt me warmly by the hand, and said he had been in
America, Upper Canada, Africa, Asia Minor, and other towns, and
he'd never met a man he liked as much as he did me.</p>
<p>"Let us," he added, "let us to the shrine of Bachus!"</p>
<p>And he dragged me into a public house.&nbsp; I was determined to
pay, so I said, "Mr. Bachus, giv this gen'l'man what he calls
for."</p>
<p>We conversed there in a very pleasant manner till my dinner-time
arrove, when the agreeable gentleman insisted that I should dine
with him.&nbsp; "We'll have a banquet, Sir, fit for the gods!"</p>
<p>I told him good plain vittles would soot me.&nbsp; If the gods
wanted to have the dispepsy, they was welcome to it.</p>
<p>We had soop and fish, and a hot jint, and growsis, and wines of
rare and costly vintige.&nbsp; We had ices, and we had froots from
Greenland's icy mountins and Injy's coral strands; and when the
sumptoous reparst was over, the agree'ble man said he'd unfortnitly
left his pocket-book at home on the marble centre- table.</p>
<p>"But, by Jove!" he said, "it was a feast fit for the gods!"</p>
<p>I said, "Oh, never mind," and drew out my puss; tho' I in'ardly
wished the gods, as the dinner was fit for 'em, was there to pay
for it.</p>
<p>I come of a very clever fam'ly.</p>
<p>The agree'ble gentleman then said, "Now, I will show you our
Club.&nbsp; It dates back to the time of William the
Conquerer."</p>
<p>"Did Bill belong to it?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"He did."</p>
<p>"Wall," I said, "if Billy was one of 'em, I need no other
endorsement as to its respectfulness, and I'll go with you, my gay
trooper boy!"&nbsp; And we went off arm-in-arm.</p>
<p>On the way the agree'ble man told me that the Club was called
the Sloshers.&nbsp; He said I would notice that none of 'em
appeared in evenin dress.&nbsp; He said it was agin the rools of
the club.&nbsp; In fack, if any member appeared there in evenin
dress he'd be instantly expeld.&nbsp; "And yit," he added, "there's
geneyus there, and lorfty emotions, and intelleck.&nbsp; You'll be
surprised at the quantities of intelleck you'll see there."</p>
<p>We reached the Sloshers in due time, and I must say they was a
shaky-looking lot, and the public house where they convened was
certingly none of the best.</p>
<p>The Sloshers crowded round me, and said I was welcome.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful brest-pin you've got," said one of 'em.&nbsp;
"Permit me," and he took it out of my neckercher.&nbsp; "Isn't it
luvly," he said, parsin it to another, who parsed it to
another.</p>
<p>It was given me by my Aunt, on my promisin her I'd never swear
profanely; and I never have, except on very special
occasions.&nbsp; I see that beautiful boosum pin a parsin from one
Slosher to another, and I'm reminded of them sad words of the poit,
"parsin away! parsin away!"&nbsp; I never saw it no more.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/21.gif" alt=
"picture of Ward accosted by athletic female" /> Then in comes a
athletic female, who no sooner sees me than she utters a wild yell,
and cries:</p>
<p>"At larst! at larst!&nbsp; My Wilyim, from the seas!"</p>
<p>I said, "not at all, Marm.&nbsp; Not on no account.&nbsp; I have
heard the boatswain pipe to quarters&mdash;but a voice in my heart
didn't whisper Seu-zan!&nbsp; I've belayed the marlin-spikes on the
upper jibpoop, but Seu-zan's eye wasn't on me, much.&nbsp; Young
woman, I am not you're Saler boy.&nbsp; Far different."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you are!" she howled, seizin me round the neck.&nbsp;
"Oh, how I've lookt forwards to this meetin!"</p>
<p>"And you'll presently," I said, "have a opportunity of lookin
backwards to it, because I'm on the point of leavin this
institution."</p>
<p>I will here observe that I come of a very clever family.&nbsp; A
very clever fam'ly, indeed.</p>
<p>"Where," I cried, as I struggled in vain to release myself from
the eccentric female's claws, "where is the Capting&mdash;the man
who was into the Crimea, amidst the cannon's thunder?&nbsp; I want
him."</p>
<p>He came forward, and cried, "What do I see?&nbsp; Me Sister! me
sweet Adulaide! and in teers!&nbsp; Willin!" he screamed, "and
you're the serpent I took to my boosum, and borrowed money of, and
went round with, and was cheerful with, are you?&mdash;You ought to
be ashamed of yourself."</p>
<p>Somehow my coat was jerked off, the brest-pocket of which
contained my pocket-book, and it parsed away like the brest
pin.&nbsp; Then they sorter quietly hustled me into the street.</p>
<p>It was about 12 at night when I reached the Green Lion.</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! you sly old rascal, you've been up to larks!" said the
lan'lord, larfin loudly, and digging his fist into my ribs.</p>
<p>I said, "Bigsby, if you do that agin, I shall hit you!&nbsp;
Much as I respect you and your excellent faml'y, I shall disfiger
your beneverlent countenance for life!"</p>
<p>"What has ruffled your spirits, friend?" said the lan'lord.</p>
<p>"My spirits has been ruffled," I ansered in a bittur voice, "by
a viper who was into the Crimea.&nbsp; What good was it," I cried,
"for Sebastopol to fall down without enwelopin in its ruins that
viper?"</p>
<p>I then went to bed.&nbsp; I come of a very clever fam'ly.</p>

<center>
<p>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH, My dear Sir,&mdash;I skurcely need inform you that
your excellent Tower is very pop'lar with peple from the
agricultooral districks, and it was chiefly them class which I
found waitin at the gates the other mornin.</p>
<p>I saw at once that the Tower was established on a firm
basis.&nbsp; In the entire history of firm basisis I don't find a
basis more firmer than this one.</p>
<p>"You have no Tower in America?" said a man in the crowd, who had
somehow detected my denomination.</p>
<p>"Alars! no," I ansered; "we boste of our enterprise and
improvements, and yit we are devoid of a Tower.&nbsp; America, oh
my onhappy country! thou hast not got no Tower!&nbsp; It's a sweet
Boon."</p>
<p>The gates was opened after awhile, and we all purchist tickets
and went into a waitin-room.</p>
<p>"My frens," said a pale-faced little man, in black close, "this
is a sad day."</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as to how?" I said.</p>
<p>"I mean it is sad to think that so many peple have been killed
within these gloomy walls.&nbsp; My frens, let us drop a tear!"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "you must excuse me.&nbsp; Others may drop one if
they feel like it; but as for me, I decline.&nbsp; The early
managers of this institootion were a bad lot, and their crimes were
trooly orful; but I can't sob for those who died four or five
hundred years ago.&nbsp; If they was my own relations I
couldn't.&nbsp; It's absurd to shed sobs over things which occurd
during the rain of Henry the Three.&nbsp; Let us be cheerful," I
continnerd "Look at the festiv Warders, in their red flannil
jackets.&nbsp; They are cheerful, and why should it not be thusly
with us?"</p>
<p>A Warder now took us in charge, and showed us the Trater's Gate,
the armers, and things.&nbsp; The Trater's Gate is wide enuff to
admit about twenty trater's abrest, I should jedge; but beyond
this, I couldn't see that it was superior to gates in gen'ral.</p>
<p>Traters, I will here remark, are a onfortnit class of
peple.&nbsp; If they wasn't, they wouldn't be traters.&nbsp; They
conspire to bust up a country&mdash;they fail, and they're
traters.&nbsp; They bust her, and they become statesmen and
heroes.</p>
<p>Take the case of Gloster, afterwards Old Dick the Three, who may
be seen at the Tower, on horseback, in a heavy tin
overcoat&mdash;take Mr. Gloster's case.&nbsp; Mr. G. was a
conspirater of the basist dye, and if he'd failed, he would have
been hung on a sour apple tree.&nbsp; But Mr. G. succeeded, and
became great.&nbsp; He was slewd by Col. Richmond, but he lives in
histry, and his equestrian figger may be seen daily for a sixpence,
in conjunction with other em'nent persons, and no extra charge for
the Warder's able and bootiful lectur.</p>
<p>There's one king in the room who is mounted onto a foamin steed,
his right hand graspin a barber's pole.&nbsp; I didn't learn his
name.</p>
<p>The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins is kept
is interestin.&nbsp; Among this collection of choice cutlery I
notist the bow and arrer which those hot-heded old chaps used to
conduct battles with.&nbsp; It is quite like the bow and arrer used
at this day by certin tribes of American Injuns, and they shoot 'em
off with such a excellent precision that I almost sigh'd to be a
Injun, when I was in the Rocky Mountain regin.&nbsp; They are a
pleasant lot them Injuns.&nbsp; Mr. Cooper and Dr. Catlin have told
us of the red man's wonerful eloquence, and I found it so.&nbsp;
Our party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a band of Shoshones,
whose chief said:&nbsp; "Brothers! the pale-face is welcome.&nbsp;
Brothers! the sun is sinkin in the West, and Wa-na-bucky-she will
soon cease speakin.&nbsp; Brothers! the poor red man belongs to a
race which is fast becomin extink."&nbsp; He then whooped in a
shrill manner, stole all our blankets and whisky, and fled to the
primeval forest to conceal his emotions.</p>
<p>I will remark here, while on the subjeck of Injuns, that they
are in the main a very shaky set, with even less sense than the
Fenians, and when I hear philanthropists bewailin the fack that
every year "carries the noble red man nearer the settin sun," I
simply have to say I'm glad of it, tho' it is rough on the settin
sun.&nbsp; They call you by the sweet name of Brother one minit,
and the next they scalp you with their Thomashawks.&nbsp; But I
wander. Let us return to the Tower.</p>
<p>At one end of the room where the weppins is kept, is a wax
figger of Queen Elizabeth, mounted on a fiery stuffed hoss, whose
glass eye flashes with pride, and whose red morocker nostril
dilates hawtily, as if conscious of the royal burden he
bears.&nbsp; I have associated Elizabeth with the Spanish
Armady.&nbsp; She's mixed up with it at the Surry Theatre, where
"Troo to the Core" is bein acted, and in which a full bally core is
introjooced on board the Spanish Admiral's ship, givin the audiens
the idee that he intends openin a moosic-hall in Plymouth the
moment he conkers that town.&nbsp; But a very interesting drammer
is "Troo to the Core," notwithstandin the eccentric conduck of the
Spanish Admiral; and very nice it is in Queen Elizabeth to make
Martin Truegold a baronet.</p>
<p>The Warder shows us some instrooments of tortur, such as
thumbscrews, throat-collars, etc., statin that these was conkerd
from the Spanish Armady, and addin what a crooil peple the
Spaniards was in them days&mdash;which elissited from a bright eyed
little girl of about twelve summers the remark that she tho't it
<i>was</i> rich to talk about the crooilty of the Spaniards usin
thumbscrews, when we was in a Tower where so many poor pepl's heads
had been cut off.&nbsp; This made the Warder stammer and turn
red.</p>
<p>I was so blessed with the little girl's brightness that I could
have kissed the dear child, and I would if she'd been six years
older.</p>
<p>I think my companions intended makin a day of it, for they all
had sandwiches, sassiges, etc.&nbsp; The sad-lookin man, who had
wanted us to drop a tear afore we started to go round, fling'd such
quantities of sassige into his mouth, that I expected to see him
choke hisself to death.&nbsp; He said to me, in the Beauchamp
Tower, where the poor prisoners writ their onhappy names on the
cold walls, "This is a sad sight."</p>
<p>"It is, indeed," I anserd.&nbsp; "You're black in the
face.&nbsp; You shouldn't eat sassige in public without some
rehearsals beforehand.&nbsp; You manage it orkwardly."</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I mean this sad room."</p>
<p>Indeed, he was quite right.&nbsp; Tho' so long ago all these
drefful things happened, I was very glad to git away from this
gloomy room, and go where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils is
kept.&nbsp; I was so pleased with the Queen's Crown, that it occurd
to me what a agree'ble surprise it would be to send a sim'lar one
home to my wife; and I asked the Warder what was the vally of a
good, well-constructed Crown like that.&nbsp; He told me, but on
cypherin up with a pencil the amount of funs I have in the Jint
Stock Bank, I conclooded I'd send her a genteel silver watch
instid.</p>
<p>And so I left the Tower.&nbsp; It is a solid and commandin
edifis, but I deny that it is cheerful.&nbsp; I bid it adoo without
a pang.</p>
<p>I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly driver of a
four-wheeler that I ever saw.&nbsp; He heaved a deep sigh as I gave
him two shillings.</p>
<p>"I'll give you six d.'s more," I said, "if it hurts you so."</p>
<p>"It isn't that," he said, with a hart-rendin groan, "it's only a
way I have.&nbsp; My mind's upset to-day.&nbsp; I at one time tho't
I'd drive you into the Thames.&nbsp; I've been readin in all the
daily papers to try and understand about Governor Ayre, and my mind
is totterin.&nbsp; It's really wonderful I didn't drive you into
the Thames."</p>
<p>I asked the onhappy man what his number was, so I could redily
find him in case I should want him agin, and bad him
good-bye.&nbsp; And then I tho't what a frollicksome day I'd made
of it.</p>

<p>SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH, My dear Sir,&mdash;I was a little disapinted in not
receivin a invitation to jine in the meetins of the Social Science
Congress.</p>
<p>I don't exackly see how they go on without me.</p>
<p>I hope it wasn't the intentions of the Sciencers to exclood me
from their deliberations.</p>
<p>Let it pars.&nbsp; I do not repine.&nbsp; Let us remember
Homer.&nbsp; Twenty cities claim Homer dead, thro' which the livin
Mr. Homer couldn't have got trusted for a sandwich and a glass of
bitter beer, or words to that effect.</p>
<p>But perhaps it was a oversight.&nbsp; Certinly I have been
hospitably rec'd in this country.&nbsp; Hospitality has been pored
all over me.&nbsp; At Liverpool I was asked to walk all over the
docks, which are nine miles along; and I don't remember a instance
since my 'rival in London of my gettin into a cab without a Briton
comin and perlitly shuttin the door for me, and then extendin his
open hand to'ards me, in the most frenly manner possible.&nbsp;
Does he not, by this simple yit tuchin gesture, welcum me to
England?&nbsp; Doesn't he?&nbsp; Oh yes&mdash;I guess he doesn't
he.&nbsp; And it's quite right among two great countries which
speak the same langwidge, except as regards H's.&nbsp; And I've
been allowed to walk round all the streets.&nbsp; Even at Buckinham
Pallis, I told a guard I wanted to walk round there, and he said I
could walk round there.&nbsp; I ascertained subsequent that he
referd to the sidewalk instid of the Pallis&mdash;but I couldn't
doubt his hospital feelins.</p>
<p>I prepared a Essy on Animals to read before the Social Science
meetins.&nbsp; It is a subjeck I may troothfully say I have
successfully wrastled with.&nbsp; I tackled it when only nineteen
years old.&nbsp; At that tender age I writ a Essy for a lit'ry
Institoot entitled, "Is Cats to be Trusted?"&nbsp; Of the merits of
that Essy it doesn't becum me to speak, but I may be excoos'd for
mentionin that the Institoot parsed a resolution that "whether we
look upon the length of this Essy, or the manner in which it is
written, we feel that we will not express any opinion of it, and we
hope it will be read in other towns."</p>
<p>Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science Society is a
more finisheder production than the one on Cats, which was wroten
when my mind was crood, and afore I had masterd a graceful and
ellygant stile of composition.&nbsp; I could not even punctooate my
sentences proper at that time, and I observe with pane, on lookin
over this effort of my yooth, that its beauty is in one or two
instances mar'd by ingrammaticisms.&nbsp; This was unexcusable, and
I'm surprised I did it.&nbsp; A writer who can't write in a
grammerly manner better shut up shop.</p>
<p>You shall hear this Essy on Animals.&nbsp; Some day when you
have four hours to spare, I'll read it to you.&nbsp; I think you'll
enjoy it.&nbsp; Or, what will be much better, if I may
suggest&mdash;omit all picturs in next week's "Punch," and do not
let your contributors write enything whatever (let them have a
holiday; they can go to the British Mooseum;) and publish my Essy
intire.&nbsp; It will fill all your collumes full, and create
comment.&nbsp; Does this proposition strike you?&nbsp; Is it a
go?"</p>
<p>In case I had read the Essy to the Social Sciencers, I had
intended it should be the closin attraction.&nbsp; I had intended
it should finish the proceedins.&nbsp; I think it would have
finished them.&nbsp; I understand animals better than any other
class of human creatures.&nbsp; I have a very animal mind, and I've
been identified with 'em doorin my entire professional career as a
showman, more especial bears, wolves, leopards and serpunts.</p>
<p>The leopard is as lively a animal as I ever came into contack
with.&nbsp; It is troo he cannot change his spots, but you can
change 'em for him with a paint-brush, as I once did in the case of
a leopard who wasn't nat'rally spotted in a attractive
manner.&nbsp; In exhibitin him I used to stir him up in his cage
with a protracted pole, and for the purpuss of making him yell and
kick up in a leopardy manner, I used to casionally whack him over
the head.&nbsp; This would make the children inside the booth
scream with fright, which would make fathers of families outside
the booth very anxious to come in&mdash;because there is a large
class of parents who have a uncontrollable passion for takin their
children to places where they will stand a chance of being
frightened to death.</p>
<p>One day I whacked this leopard more than ushil, which elissited
a remonstrance from a tall gentleman in spectacles, who said, "My
good man, do not beat the poor caged animal.&nbsp; Rather fondle
him."</p>
<p>"I'll fondle him with a club," I anserd, hitting him another
whack.</p>
<p>"I prythy desist," said the gentleman; "stand aside, and see the
effeck of kindness.&nbsp; I understand the idiosyncracies of these
creeturs better than you do."</p>
<p>With that he went up to the cage, and thrustin his face in
between the iron bars, he said, soothinly, "Come hither, pretty
creetur."</p>
<p>The pretty creetur come-hithered rayther speedy, and seized the
gentleman by the whiskers, which he tore off about enuff to stuff a
small cushion with.</p>
<p>He said, "You vagabone, I'll have you indicted for exhibitin
dangerous and immoral animals."</p>
<p>I replied, "Gentle Sir, there isn't a animal here that hasn't a
beautiful moral, but you mustn't fondle 'em.&nbsp; You mustn't
meddle with their idiotsyncracies."</p>
<p>The gentleman was a dramatic cricket, and he wrote a article for
a paper, in which he said my entertainment was a decided
failure.</p>
<p>As regards Bears, you can teach 'em to do interesting things,
but they're onreliable.&nbsp; I had a very large grizzly bear once,
who would dance, and larf, and lay down, and bow his head in grief,
and give a mournful wale, etsetry.&nbsp; But he often annoyed
me.&nbsp; It will be remembered that on the occasion of the first
battle of Bull Run, it suddenly occurd to the Fed'ral soldiers that
they had business in Washington which ought not to be neglected,
and they all started for that beautiful and romantic city,
maintaining a rate of speed durin the entire distance that would
have done credit to the celebrated French steed "Gladiateur."&nbsp;
Very nat'rally our Gov'ment was deeply grieved at this defeat; and
I said to my Bear, shortly after, as I was givin a exhibition in
Ohio&mdash;I said, "Brewin, are you not sorry the National arms has
sustained a defeat?"&nbsp; His business was to wale dismal, and bow
his head down, the band (a barrel organ and a wiolin) playin slow
and melancholly moosic.&nbsp; What did the grizzly old cuss do,
however, but commence darncin and larfin in the most joyous
manner?&nbsp; I had a narrer escape from being imprisoned for
disloyalty.</p>
<p>I will relate another incident in the career of this retchid
Bear.&nbsp; I used to present what I called in the bills a
Beautiful living Pictur&mdash;showing the Bear's fondness for his
Master:&nbsp; in which I'd lay down on a piece of carpeting, and
the Bear would come and lay down beside me, restin his right paw on
my breast, the Band playing "Home, Sweet Home," very soft and
slow.&nbsp; Altho' I say it, it was a tuchin thing to see.&nbsp;
I've seen Tax-Collectors weep over that performance.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="images/22.gif" alt=
"picture of Ward embraced by bear" /> Well, one day I said, "Ladies
and Gentlemen, we will show you the Bear's fondness for his
master," and I went and laid down.&nbsp; I tho't I observed a
pecooliar expression into his eyes, as he rolled clumsily to'ards
me, but I didn't dream of the scene which follered.&nbsp; He laid
down, and put his paw on my breast.&nbsp; "Affection of the Bear
for his Master," I repeated.&nbsp; "You see the Monarch of the
Western Wilds in a subjugated state.&nbsp; Fierce as these animals
naturally are, we now see that they have hearts and can love.&nbsp;
This Bear, the largest in the world, and measurin seventeen feet
round the body, loves me as a mer-ther loves her che-ild!"&nbsp;
But what was my horror when the grizzly and infamus Bear threw his
other paw <i>under</i> me, and riz with me to his feet.&nbsp; Then
claspin me in a close embrace he waltzed up and down the platform
in a frightful manner, I yellin with fear and anguish.&nbsp; To
make matters wuss, a low scurrilus young man in the audiens
hollered out:</p>
<p>"Playfulness of the Bear!&nbsp; Quick moosic!"</p>
<p>I jest 'scaped with my life.&nbsp; The Bear met with a wiolent
death the next day, by bein in the way when a hevily loaded gun was
fired off by one of my men.</p>
<p>But you should hear my Essy which I wrote for the Social Science
Meetins.&nbsp; It would have had a movin effeck on them.</p>
<p>I feel that I must now conclood.</p>
<p>I have read Earl Bright's speech at Leeds, and I hope we shall
now hear from John Derby.&nbsp; I trust that not only they, but Wm.
E. Stanley and Lord Gladstone will cling inflexibly to those great
fundamental principles, which they understand far better than I do,
and I will add that I do not understand anything about any of them
whatever in the least&mdash;and let us all be happy, and live
within our means, even if we have to borrer money to do it
with.</p>

<p>A VISIT TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>MR. PUNCH, My dear Sir,&mdash;You didn't get a instructiv
article from my pen last week on account of my nervus sistim havin
underwent a dreffle shock.&nbsp; I got caught in a brief shine of
sun, and it utterly upsot me.&nbsp; I was walkin in Regent Street
one day last week, enjoyin your rich black fog and bracing rains,
when all at once the Sun bust out and actooally shone for nearly
half an hour steady.&nbsp; I acted promptly.&nbsp; I called a cab
and told the driver to run his hoss at a friteful rate of speed to
my lodgins, but it wasn't of no avale.&nbsp; I had orful cramps,
and my appytite left me, and my pults went down to 10 degrees below
zero.&nbsp; But by careful nussin I shall no doubt recover speedy,
if the present sparklin and exileratin weather continners.</p>
<p>[All of the foregoin is sarcasum.]</p>
<p>It's a sing'lar fack, but I never sot eyes on your excellent
British Mooseum till the other day.&nbsp; I've sent a great many
peple there, as also to your genial Tower of London, however.&nbsp;
It happened thusly: When one of my excellent countrymen jest
arrived in London would come and see me, and display a inclination
to cling to me too lengthy, thus showing a respect for me which I
feel I do not deserve, I would sugjest a visit to the Mooseum and
Tower.&nbsp; The Mooseum would ockepy him a day at leest, and the
Tower another.&nbsp; Thus I've derived considerable peace and
comfort from them noble edifisses, and I hope they will long
continner to grace your metroplis.&nbsp; There's my fren Col.
Larkins, from Wisconsin, who I regret to say understands the
Jamaica question, and wants to talk with me about it; I sent him to
the Tower four days ago, and he hasn't got throogh with it
yit.&nbsp; He likes it very much, and he writes me that he can't
never thank me sufficient for directin him to so interestin a
bildin.&nbsp; I writ him not to mention it.&nbsp; The Col. says it
is fortnit we live in a intellectooal age which wouldn't
countenance such infamus things as occurd in this Tower.&nbsp; I'm
aware that it is fashin'ble to compliment this age, but I ain't so
clear that the Col. is altogether right.&nbsp; This is a very
respectable age, but it's pretty easily riled; and considerin upon
how slight a provycation we who live in it go to cuttin each
other's throats, it may perhaps be doubted whether our intellecks
is so much massiver than our ancestors' intellecks was, after
all.</p>
<p>I allus ride outside with the cabman.&nbsp; I am of humble
parentage, but I have (if you will permit me to say so) the spirit
of the eagle, which chafes when shut up in a four-wheeler, and I
feel much eagler when I'm in the open air.&nbsp; So on the mornin
on which I went to the Mooseum I lit a pipe, and callin a cab, I
told the driver to take me there as quick as his Arabian charger
could go.&nbsp; The driver was under the inflooence of beer and
narrerly escaped runnin over a aged female in the match trade,
whereupon I remonstratid with him.&nbsp; I said, "That poor old
woman may be the only mother of a young man like you." Then
throwing considerable pathos into my voice, I said:&nbsp; Then
throwing considerable pathos into my voice I said, "You have a
mother?"</p>
<p>He said, "You lie!"&nbsp; I got down and called another cab, but
said nothin to this driver about his parents.</p>
<p>The British Mooseum is a magnificent free show for the
people.&nbsp; It is kept open for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>The humble costymonger, who traverses the busy streets with a
cart containin all kinds of vegetables, such as carrots, turnips,
etc, and drawn by a spirited jackass&mdash;he can go to the Mooseum
and reap benefits therefrom as well as the lord of high degree.</p>
<p>"And this," I said, "is the British Mooseum!&nbsp; "These noble
walls," I continnerd, punching them with my umbreller to see if the
masonry was all right&mdash;but I wasn't allowd to finish my
enthoosiastic remarks, for a man with a gold band on his hat said,
in a hash voice, that I must stop pokin the walls.&nbsp; I told him
I would do so by all means.&nbsp; "You see," I said, taking hold of
the tassel which waved from the man's belt, and drawin him close to
me in a confidential way, "You see, I'm lookin round this Mooseum,
and if I like it I shall buy it."</p>
<p>Instid of larfin hartily at these remarks, which was made in a
goakin spirit, the man frowned darkly and walked away.</p>
<p>I first visited the stuffed animals, of which the gorillers
interested me most.&nbsp; These simple-minded monsters live in
Afriky, and are believed to be human beins to a slight extent,
altho' they are not allowed to vote.&nbsp; In this department is
one or two superior giraffes.&nbsp; I never woulded I were a bird,
but I've sometimes wished I was a giraffe, on account of the long
distance from his mouth to his stummuck.&nbsp; Hence, if he loved
beer, one mugful would give him as much enjoyment while goin down,
as forty mugfuls would ordinary persons.&nbsp; And he wouldn't get
intoxicated, which is a beastly way of amusin oneself, I must
say.&nbsp; I like a little beer now and then, and when the
teetotallers inform us, as they frekently do, that it is vile
stuff, and that even the swine shrink from it, I say it only shows
that the swine is a ass who don't know what's good; but to pour gin
and brandy down one's throat as freely as though it were fresh
milk, is the most idiotic way of goin' to the devil that I know
of.</p>
<p>I enjoyed myself very much lookin at the Egyptian mummays, the
Greek vasis, etc, but it occurd to me there was rayther too many
"Roman antiquitys of a uncertin date."&nbsp; Now, I like the
British Mooseum, as I said afore, but when I see a lot of erthen
jugs and pots stuck up on shelves, and all "of a uncertin date,"
I'm at a loss to 'zackly determin whether they are a thousand years
old or was bought recent.&nbsp; I can cry like a child over a jug
one thousand years of age, especially if it is a Roman jug; but a
jug of a uncertin date doesn't overwhelm me with emotions.&nbsp;
Jugs and pots of a uncertin age is doubtles vallyable property,
but, like the debentures of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway,
a man doesn't want too many of them.</p>
<p>I was debarred out of the great readin-room.&nbsp; A man told me
I must apply by letter for admission, and that I must get somebody
to testify that I was respectable.&nbsp; I'm a little 'fraid I
shan't get in there.&nbsp; Seein a elderly gentleman, with a
beneverlent-lookin face near by, I venturd to ask him if he would
certify that I was respectable.&nbsp; He said he certainly would
not, but he would put me in charge of a policeman, if that would do
me any good.&nbsp; A thought struck me.&nbsp; "I refer you to 'Mr.
Punch'," I said.</p>
<p>"Well," said a man, who had listened to my application, "you
<i>have</i> done it now!&nbsp; You stood some chance before."</p>
<p>I will get this infamus wretch's name before you go to press, so
you can denounce him in the present number of your excellent
journal.</p>
<p>The statute of Apollo is a pretty slick statute.&nbsp; A young
yeoman seemed deeply imprest with it.&nbsp; He viewd it with silent
admiration.&nbsp; At home, in the beautiful rural districks where
the daisy sweetly blooms, he would be swearin in a horrible manner
at his bullocks, and whacking 'em over the head with a hayfork; but
here, in the presence of Art, he is a changed bein.</p>
<p>I told the attendant that if the British nation would stand the
expens of a marble bust of myself, I would willingly sit to some
talented sculpist.</p>
<p>"I feel," I said, "that this is a dooty I owe to posterity."</p>
<p>He said it was hily prob'l, but he was inclined to think that
the British nation wouldn't care to enrich the Mooseum with a bust
of me, altho' he venturd to think that if I paid for one myself it
would be accepted cheerfully by Madam Tussaud, who would give it a
prom'nent position in her Chamber of Horrers.&nbsp; The young man
was very polite, and I thankt him kindly.</p>
<p>After visitin the Refreshment room and partakin of half a
chicken "of a uncertin age," like the Roman antiquitys I have
previsly spoken of, I prepared to leave.&nbsp; As I passed through
the animal room I observed with pane that a benevolint person was
urgin the stufft elephant to accept a cold muffin, but I did not
feel called on to remostrate with him, any more than I did with two
young persons of diff'rent sexes who had retired behind the
Rynosserhoss to squeeze each other's hands.&nbsp; In fack, I
rayther approved of the latter proceedin, for it carrid me back to
the sunny spring-time of MY life.&nbsp; I'm in the shear and yeller
leaf now, but I don't forgit the time when to squeeze my Betsy's
hand sent a thrill through me like fellin off the roof of a
two-story house; and I never squozed that gentle hand without
wantin to do so some more, and feelin that it did me good.</p>

<p>PART VI. ARTEMUS WARD'S PANORAMA.</p>

<p><a name="note" id="note"></a> REFATORY NOTE BY MELVILLE D.
LANDON.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>The fame of Artemus Ward culminated in his last lectures at
Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, the final one breaking off abruptly on
the evening of the 23d of January, 1867.&nbsp; That night the great
humorist bade farewell to the public, and retired from the stage to
die!&nbsp; His Mormon lectures were immensely successful in
England.&nbsp; His fame became the talk of journalists, savants,
and statesmen.&nbsp; Every one seemed to be affected differently,
but every one felt and acknowledged his power.&nbsp; "The Honorable
Robert Lowe," says Mr. E.P. HINGSTON, Artemus Ward's bosom friend,
"attended the Mormon lecture one evening, and laughed as
hilariously as any one in the room.&nbsp; The next evening Mr. John
Bright happened to be present.&nbsp; With the exception of one or
two occasional smiles, he listened with <i>grave</i>
attention."</p>
<p>The "London Standard," in describing his first lecture in
London, aptly said, "Artemus dropped his jokes faster than the
meteors of last night succeeded each other in the sky.&nbsp; And
there was this resemblance between the flashes of his humor and the
flights of the meteors, that in each case one looked for jokes or
meteors, but they always came just in the place that one least
expected to find them.&nbsp; Half the enjoyment of the evening lay,
to some of those present, in listening to the hearty cachinnation
of the people, who only found out the jokes some two or three
minutes after they were made, and who laughed apparently at some
grave statements of fact.&nbsp; Reduced to paper, the showman's
jokes are certainly not brilliant; almost their whole effect lies
in their seeming impromptu character.&nbsp; They are carefully led
up to, of course; but they are uttered as if they are mere
afterthoughts of which the speaker is hardly sure."</p>
<p>His humor was so entirely fresh and unconventional, that it took
his hearers by surprise, and charmed them.&nbsp; His failing health
compelled him to abandon the lecture after about eight or ten
weeks.&nbsp; Indeed, during that brief period he was once or twice
compelled to dismiss his audience.&nbsp; Frequently he sank into a
chair and nearly fainted from the exertion of dressing.&nbsp; He
exhibited the greatest anxiety to be at his post at the appointed
time, and scrupulously exerted himself to the utmost to entertain
his auditors.&nbsp; It was not because he was sick that the public
was to be disappointed, or that their enjoyment was to be
diminished.&nbsp; During the last few weeks of his lecture-giving,
he steadily abstained from accepting any of the numerous
invitations he received.&nbsp; Had he lived through the following
London fashionable season, there is little doubt that the room at
the Egyptian Hall would have been thronged nightly.&nbsp; The
English aristocracy have a fine, delicate sense of humor, and the
success, artistic and pecuniary, of "Artemus Ward" would have
rivalled that of the famous "Lord Dundreary."&nbsp; There were many
stupid people who did not understand the "fun" of Artemus Ward's
books.&nbsp; There were many stupid people who did not understand
the fun of Artemus Ward's lecture on the Mormons.&nbsp; Highly
respectable people&mdash;the pride of their parish&mdash;when they
heard of a lecture "upon the Mormons," expected to see a solemn
person, full of old saws and new statistics, who would denounce the
sin of polygamy,&mdash;and rave without limit against
Mormons.&nbsp; These uncomfortable Christians do not like
humor.&nbsp; They dread it as a certain personage is said to dread
holy water, and for the same reason that thieves fear
policemen&mdash;it finds them out.&nbsp; When these good idiots
heard Artemus offer if they did not like the lecture in Piccadilly,
to give them free tickets for the same lecture in California, when
he next visited that country, they turned to each other
indignantly, and said, "What use are tickets for California to
<i>us</i>? WE are not going to California.&nbsp; No! we are too
good, too respectable to go so far from home.&nbsp; The man is a
fool!"&nbsp; One of these vestrymen complained to the doorkeeper,
and denounced the lecturer as an impostor&mdash;"and," said the
wealthy parishioner, "as for the panorama, it is the worst painted
thing I ever saw."</p>
<p>During the lecture Artemus was always as solemn as the
grave.&nbsp; Sometimes he would seem to forget his audience, and
stand for several seconds gazing intently at his panorama.&nbsp;
Then he would start up and remark apologetically, "I am very fond
of looking at my pictures."&nbsp; His dress was always the
same&mdash;evening toilet.&nbsp; His manners were polished, and his
voice gentle and hesitating.&nbsp; Many who had read of the man who
spelled joke with a "g," looked for a smart old man with a shrewd
cock eye, dressed in vulgar velvet and gold, and they were hardly
prepared to see the accomplished gentleman with slim physique and

<p>The letters of Artemus Ward in "Punch" from the tomb of
Shakspeare and the London Tower, had made him famous in England,
and in his audience were the nobility of the realm.&nbsp; His first
lecture in London was delivered at Egyptian Hall, on Tuesday,
November 13th, 1866.&nbsp; The room used was that which had been
occupied by Mr. Arthur Sketchley, adjoining the one in which Mr.
Arthur Smith formerly made his appearances.&nbsp; The stage, with
the curtain down, had this appearance while Artemus was delivering
his prologue:</p>
<center><img src="images/23.gif" alt=
"Drawing of stage with curtain closed and eight footlights." /></center>
<p>Punctually at eight o'clock he would step hesitatingly before
the audience, and rubbing his hands bashfully, commence the
lecture.</p>

LECTURE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>You are entirely welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to my little
picture-shop.</p>
<p>I couldn't give you a very clear idea of the Mormons&mdash;and
Utah&mdash;and the Plains&mdash;and the Rocky
Mountains&mdash;without opening a picture-shop&mdash;and therefore
I open one.</p>
<p>I don't expect to do great things here&mdash;but I have thought
that if I could make money enough to by me a passage to New Zealand
I should feel that I had not lived in vain.</p>
<p><b>I don't want to live in vain.&mdash;I'd rather live in
Margate&mdash;</b> or here.&nbsp; But I wish when the Egyptians
built this hall they had given it a little more ventilation.</p>
<p>If you should be dissatisfied with anything here
to-night&mdash;I will admit you all free in New
Zealand&mdash;<font size="2">if you will come to me there for the
orders</font>.&nbsp; <b>Any respectable cannibal will tell you
where I live.</b>&nbsp; This shows that I have a forgiving
spirit.</p>
<p>I really don't care for money.&nbsp; I only travel round to see
the world and to exhibit my clothes.&nbsp; <b>These clothes I have
on were a great success in America.</b></p>
<p>How often do large fortunes ruin young men!&nbsp; <b>I should
like to be ruined,</b> but I can get on very well as I am.</p>
<p>I am not an Artist.&nbsp; I don't paint myself&mdash;though
perhaps if I were <font size="2">a middle-aged single lady I
should</font>&mdash;yet I have a passion for pictures&mdash;I have
had a great many pictures&mdash;photographs taken of myself.&nbsp;
Some of them are very pretty&mdash;<b>rather sweet to look at for a
short time</b>&mdash;and as I said before, I like them.&nbsp; I've
always loved pictures.</p>
<p>I could draw on wood at a very tender age.&nbsp; When a mere
child <b>I once drew a small cart-load of raw turnips over a wooden
bridge</b>.&mdash;The people of the village noticed me.&nbsp; I
drew their attention.&nbsp; They said I had a future before
me.&nbsp; Up to that time I had an idea it was behind me.</p>
<p>Time passed on.&nbsp; It always does, by the way.&nbsp; <b>You
may possibly have noticed that Time passes
on</b>.&mdash;<font size="2">It is a kind of way Time
has</font>.</p>
<p>I became a man.&nbsp; I haven't distinguished myself at all as
an artist&mdash;but I have always been more or less mixed up with
Art.&nbsp; I have an uncle who takes photographs&mdash;and I have a
servant who&mdash;takes anything <font size="2">he can get his
hands on</font>.</p>
<p>When I was in Rome&mdash;Rome in New York State I mean&mdash;a
distinguished sculpist wanted to sculp me.&nbsp; But I said
"No."&nbsp; I saw through the designing man.&nbsp; My model once in
his hands&mdash;he would have flooded the market with my
busts&mdash;and I couldn't stand it to see everybody going round
with a bust of me.&nbsp; Everybody would want one of
course&mdash;and wherever I should go I should meet the educated
classes with my bust, taking it home to their families.&nbsp;
<b>This would be more than my modesty could stand</b>&mdash;<b>and
I should have to return to America</b>&mdash;<font size="2">where
my creditors</font> are.</p>
<p>I like Art.&nbsp; I admire dramatic Art&mdash;although I failed
as an actor.</p>
<p>It was in my schoolboy days that I failed as an actor.&mdash;The
play was "the Ruins of Pompeii."&mdash;I played the Ruins.&nbsp; It
was not a very successful performance&mdash;but it was better than
the "Burning Mountain."&nbsp; He was not good.&nbsp; <font size=
"2">He was a bad Vesuvius.</font></p>
<p>The remembrance often makes me ask&mdash;"Where are the boys of
my youth?"&mdash;I assure you this is not a conundrum.&mdash;Some
are amongst you here&mdash;some in America&mdash;<b>some are in
gaol</b>.&mdash;</p>
<p>Hence arises a most touching question&mdash;"Where are the girls
of my youth?"&nbsp; Some are married&mdash;<b>some would like to
be</b>.</p>
<p>Oh my Maria!&nbsp; Alas! she married another.&nbsp; They
frequently <font size="2">do</font>.&nbsp; I hope she is
happy&mdash;because I am.*&mdash;some people are not happy.&nbsp; I
have noticed that.</p>
<p>*(Spoken with a sigh.&nbsp; It was a joke which always
told.&nbsp; Artemus never failed to use it in his "Babes in the
Wood" lecture, and the "Sixty Minutes in Africa," as well as in the
Mormon story.)</p>
<p>A gentleman friend of mine came to me one day with tears in his
eyes.&nbsp; I said, "Why these weeps?"&nbsp; He said he had a
mortgage on his farm&mdash;and wanted to borrow 200 pounds.&nbsp; I
lent him the money&mdash;and he went away.&nbsp; Some time after he
returned with more tears.&nbsp; He said he must leave me for
ever.&nbsp; I ventured to remind him of the 200 pounds he
borrowed.&nbsp; He was much cut up. I thought I would not be hard
upon him&mdash;so I told him I would throw off one hundred
pounds.&nbsp; He brightened&mdash;shook my hand&mdash;and
said&mdash;"Old friend&mdash;I won't allow you to outdo me in
liberality&mdash;<b>I'll throw off the other hundred</b>."</p>
<p>As a manager I was always rather more successful than as an
actor.</p>
<p>Some years ago I engaged a celebrated Living American Skeleton
for a tour through Australia.&nbsp; He was the thinnest man I ever
saw.&nbsp; He was a splendid skeleton.&nbsp; He didn't weigh
anything scarcely&mdash;and I said to myself&mdash;the people of
Australia will flock to see this tremendous curiosity.&nbsp; It is
a long voyage&mdash;as you know&mdash;from New York to
Melbourne&mdash;and to my utter surprise the skeleton had no sooner
got out to sea than he commenced eating in the most horrible
manner.&nbsp; He had never been on the ocean before&mdash;and he
said it agreed with him.&mdash;I thought so!&mdash;I never saw a
man eat so much in my life.&nbsp;
Beef&mdash;mutton&mdash;pork&mdash;he swallowed them all like a
shark&mdash;and between meals he was often discovered behind
barrels eating hard-boiled eggs.&nbsp; The result was that when we
reached Melbourne this infamous skeleton weighed 64 pounds more
than I did!</p>
<p>I thought I was ruined&mdash;but I wasn't.&nbsp; I took him on
to California&mdash;another very long sea voyage&mdash;and when I
got him to San Francisco <b>I exhibited him as a Fat
Man</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story hasn't anything to do with my Entertainment, I
know&mdash;but one of the principal features of my Entertainment
<font size="2">is that it contains so many things that don't have
anything to do with it</font>.</p>
<p>My Orchestra is small&mdash;but I am sure it is very
good&mdash;so far as it goes.&nbsp; <b>I give my pianist ten pounds
a night&mdash;and his washing</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Music.&mdash;I can't sing.&nbsp; As a singist I am not
<font size="2">a success</font>.&nbsp; I am <b>saddes</b>t when I
sing.&nbsp; <font size="2">So are those who hear me.&nbsp; They are
sadder even than I am.</font></p>
<p>The other night some silver-voiced young men came under my
window and sang&mdash;"Come where my love lies dreaming."&mdash;I
didn't go.&nbsp; <b>I didn't think it would be correct</b>.</p>
<p>I found music very soothing when I lay ill with fever in
Utah&mdash;and I was very ill&mdash;I was fearfully
wasted.&mdash;My face was hewn down to nothing&mdash;and my nose
was so sharp I didn't dare to stick it into other people's
business&mdash;<b>for fear it would stay there</b>&mdash;and I
should never get it again.&nbsp; And on those dismal days a Mormon
lady&mdash;she was married&mdash;<b>tho' not so much so as her</b>
husband&mdash;he had fifteen <font size="2">other
wives</font>&mdash;she used to sing a ballad commencing "Sweet
bird&mdash;do not fly away!"&mdash;and I told her I
wouldn't.&mdash;She played the accordion divinely&mdash;accordionly
I praised her.</p>
<p>I met a man in Oregon who hadn't any teeth&mdash;not a tooth in
his head&mdash;<b>yet that man could play on the bass drum better
than any man I ever met</b>.&mdash;He kept a hotel.&nbsp; They have
queer hotels in Oregon.&nbsp; I remember one where they gave me a
bag of oats for a pillow&mdash;<b>I had nightmares of
course.</b>&nbsp; In the morning the landlord said&mdash;How do you
feel&mdash;old hoss&mdash;hay?&mdash;I told him I felt my oats.</p>
<p>Permit me now to quietly state that altho' I am here with my cap
and bells I am also here with some serious descriptions of the
Mormons&mdash;their manners&mdash;their customs&mdash;and while the
pictures I shall present to your notice are by no means works of
art&mdash;they are painted from photographs actually taken on the
spot&mdash;and I am sure I need not inform any person present who
was ever in the territory of Utah that they are as faithful as they
could possibly be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to California on the steamer "Ariel."</p>
<center><img src="images/24.gif" alt=
"picture of 'The Ariel'" /></center>
<p>This is the steamer "Ariel."</p>
<p>Oblige me by calmly gazing on the steamer "Ariel"&mdash;<b>and
when you go to California be sure and go on some other
steamer</b>&mdash;<font size="2">because the Ariel isn't a very
good one</font>.</p>
<p>When I reached the "Ariel"&mdash;at pier No. 4&mdash;New
York&mdash;I found the passengers in a state of great confusion
about their things&mdash;which were being thrown around by the
ship's porters in a manner at once damaging and idiotic.&mdash;So
great was the excitement&mdash;my fragile form was smashed this
way&mdash;and jammed that way&mdash;till finally I was shoved into
a stateroom which was occupied by two middle-aged females&mdash;who
said, "Base man&mdash;leave us&mdash;O leave us!"&mdash;<b>I left
them&mdash;Oh&mdash;I left them!</b></p>
<p>We reach Acapulco on the coast of Mexico in due time.&nbsp;
Nothing of special interest occurred at Acapulco&mdash;only some of
the Mexican ladies are very beautiful.&nbsp; They all have
brilliant black hair&mdash;hair "black as starless night"&mdash;if
I may quote from the "Family Herald".&nbsp; It don't curl.&mdash;A
Mexican lady's hair never curls&mdash;it is straight as an
Indian's.&nbsp; Some people's hair won't curl under any
circumstances.&mdash;<font size="2">My hair won't curl under two
shillings.*</font></p>
<p>*(under two shillings)"&nbsp; Artemus always wore his hair
straight until his severe illness in Salt Lake City.&nbsp; So much
of it dropped off during his recovery that he became dissatisfied
with the long meagre appearance his countenance presented when he
surveyed it in the looking-glass.&nbsp; After his lecture at the
Salt Lake City Theatre he did not lecture again until we had
crossed the Rocky Mountains and arrived at Denver City, the capital
of Colorado.&nbsp; On the afternoon he was to lecture there I met
him coming out of an ironmonger's store with a small parcel in his
hand.&nbsp; "I want you, old fellow," he said; "I have been all
around the city for them, and I've got them at last."&nbsp; "Got
what?" I asked.&nbsp; "A pair of curling-tongs.&nbsp; I am going to
have my hair curled to lecture in to-night.&nbsp; I mean to cross
the plains in curls.&nbsp; Come home with me and try to curl it for
me.&nbsp; I don't want to go to any idiot of a barber to be laughed
at."&nbsp; I played the part of friseur.&nbsp; Subsequently he
became his own "curlist," as he phrased it.&nbsp; From that day
forth Artemus was a curly-haired man.</p>

<p>The Chinese form a large element in the population of San
Francisco&mdash;and I went to the Chinese Theatre.</p>
<p>A Chinese play often lasts two months.&nbsp; Commencing at the
hero's birth, it is cheerfully conducted from week to week till he
is <b>either killed or married</b>.</p>
<p>The night I was there a Chinese comic vocalist sang a Chinese
comic song.&nbsp; It took him six weeks to finish it&mdash;but as
my time was limited, I went away at the expiration of 215
verses.&nbsp; There were 11,000 verses to this song&mdash;the
chorus being "Tural lural dural, ri fol day"&mdash;which was
repeated twice at the end of each verse&mdash;making&mdash;as you
will at once see&mdash;the appalling number of 22,000 "tural lural
dural, ri fol days"&mdash;<b>and the man still lives</b>.</p>

<p>Virginia City&mdash;in the bright new State of Nevada.</p>
<p>A wonderful little city&mdash;right in the heart of the famous
Washoe silver regions&mdash;the mines of which annually produce
over twenty-five millions of solid silver.&nbsp; This silver is
melted into solid bricks&mdash;about the size of ordinary
house-bricks&mdash;and carted off to San Francisco with
mules.&nbsp; The roads often swarm with these silver wagons.</p>
<p>One hundred and seventy-five miles to the east of this place are
the Reese River Silver Mines&mdash;which are supposed to be the
richest in the world.</p>
<p>The great American Desert in winter time&mdash;the desert which
is so frightfully gloomy always.&nbsp; No trees&mdash;no
houses&mdash;no people&mdash;save the miserable beings who live in
wretched huts and have charge of the horses and mules of the
Overland Mail Company.</p>

<p>The most celebrated artists of London are so delighted with this
picture that they come to the Hall every day to gaze at it.&nbsp; I
wish you were nearer to it&mdash;so you could see it better.&nbsp;
I wish I could take it to your residences and let you see it by
daylight.&nbsp; Some of the greatest artists in London come here
every morning before daylight with lanterns to look at it. <b>They
say they never saw anything like it before</b>&mdash;<font size=
"2">and they hope they never shall again.</font></p>
<p>When I first showed this picture in New York, the audience were
so enthusiastic in their admiration of this picture that <b>they
called for the Artist</b>&mdash;<font size="2">and when he appeared

"picture of Salt Lake City" /></center>
<p>A bird's-eye view of Great Salt Lake City&mdash;the strange city
in the Desert about which so much has been heard&mdash;the city of
the people who call themselves Saints.</p>
<p>I know there is much interest taken in these remarkable
people&mdash;ladies and gentlemen&mdash;and I have thought it
better to make the purely descriptive part of my Entertainment
entirely serious.&mdash;I will not&mdash;then&mdash;for the next
ten minutes&mdash;confine myself to my subject.</p>
<p>Some seventeen years ago a small band of Mormons&mdash;headed by
Brigham Young&mdash;commenced in the present thrifty metropolis of
Utah.&nbsp; The population of the territory of Utah is over
100,000&mdash;chiefly Mormons&mdash;and they are increasing at the
rate of from five to ten thousand annually.&nbsp; The converts to
Mormonism now are almost exclusively confined to English and
Germans&mdash;Wales and Cornwall have contributed largely to the
population of Utah during the last few years.&nbsp; The population
of Great Salt Lake City is 20,000.&mdash;The streets are eight rods
wide&mdash;and are neither flagged nor paved.&nbsp; A stream of
pure mountain spring water courses through each street&mdash;and is
conducted into the Gardens of the Mormons.&nbsp; The houses are
mostly of adobe&mdash;or sun-dried brick&mdash;and present a neat
and comfortable appearance.&mdash;They are usually a story and a
half high.&nbsp; Now and then you see a fine modern house in Salt
Lake City&mdash;but no house that is dirty, shabby, and
dilapidated&mdash;because there are no absolutely poor people in
Utah.&nbsp; Every Mormon has a nice garden&mdash;and every Mormon
has a tidy dooryard.&mdash;Neatness is a great characteristic of
the Mormons.</p>
<p>The Mormons profess to believe that they are the chosen people
of God&mdash;they call themselves Latter-day Saints&mdash;and they
call us people of the outer world Gentiles.&nbsp; They say that Mr.
Brigham Young is a prophet&mdash;the legitimate successor of Joseph
Smith&mdash;who founded the Mormon religion.&nbsp; They also say
they are authorized&mdash;by special revelation from
Heaven&mdash;to marry as many wives as they can comfortably
support.</p>
<p>This wife-system they call plurality&mdash;the world calls it
polygamy.&nbsp; That at its best it is an accursed thing&mdash;I
need not of course inform you&mdash;but you will bear in mind that
I am here as a rather cheerful reporter of what I saw in
Utah&mdash;and I fancy it isn't at all necessary for me to grow
virtuously indignant over something we all know is hideously
wrong.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to hear&mdash;I was amazed to
see&mdash;that among the Mormon women there are some few persons of
education&mdash;of positive cultivation.&nbsp; As a class the
Mormons are not educated people&mdash;but they are by no means the
community of ignoramuses so many writers have told us they
were.</p>
<p>The valley in which they live is splendidly favored.&nbsp; They
raise immense crops.&nbsp; They have mills of all kinds.&nbsp; They
have coal&mdash;lead&mdash;and silver mines.&nbsp; All they
eat&mdash;all they drink&mdash;all they wear they can produce
themselves&mdash;and still have a great abundance to sell to the
gold regions of Idaho on the one hand&mdash;and the silver regions
of Nevada on the other.</p>
<p>The President of this remarkable community&mdash;the head of the
Mormon Church&mdash;is Brigham Young.&mdash;He is called President
Young&mdash;and Brother Brigham.&nbsp; He is about 54 years
old&mdash;altho' he doesn't look to be over 45.&nbsp; He has sandy
hair and whiskers&mdash;is of medium height&mdash;and is a little
inclined to corpulency.&nbsp; He was born in the State of
Vermont.&nbsp; His power is more absolute than that of any living
sovereign&mdash;yet he uses it with such consummate discretion that
his people are almost madly devoted to him&mdash;and that they
would cheerfully die for him if they thought the sacrifice were
demanded&mdash;I cannot doubt.</p>
<p>He is a man of enormous wealth.&mdash;One-tenth of everything
sold in the territory of Utah goes to the Church&mdash;and Mr.
Brigham Young is the Church.&nbsp; It is supposed that he
speculates with these funds&mdash;at all events&mdash;he is one of
the wealthiest men now living&mdash;worth several
millions&mdash;without doubt.&mdash;He is a bold&mdash;bad
man&mdash;but that he is also a man of extraordinary administrative
ability no one can doubt who has watched his astounding career for
the past ten years.&nbsp; It is only fair for me to add that he
treated me with marked kindness during my sojourn in Utah.</p>

"Picture of West Side of Main Street, Salt Lake City." /></center>
<p>The West Side of Main Street&mdash;Salt Lake
City&mdash;including a view of the Salt Lake Hotel.&nbsp; It is a
temperance hotel*.&nbsp;I prefer temperance hotels&mdash;altho'
they sell worse liquor than any other kind of hotels.&nbsp; But the
Salt Lake Hotel sells none&mdash;nor is there a bar in all Salt
Lake City&mdash;but I found when I was thirsty&mdash;and I
generally am&mdash;that I could get some very good brandy of one of
the Elders&mdash;on the sly&mdash;and I never on <font size="2">any
account allow my business to interfere with my drinking</font>.</p>
<p>*(At the date of our visit, there was only one place in Salt
Lake City where strong drink was allowed to be sold.&nbsp; Brigham
Young himself owned the property, and vended the liquor by
wholesale, not permitting any of it to be drunk on the
premises.&nbsp; It was a coarse, inferior kind of whisky, known in
Salt Lake as "Valley Tan."&nbsp; Throughout the city there was no
drinking-bar nor billiard room, so far as I am aware.&nbsp; But a
drink on the sly could always be had at one of the hard-goods
stores, in the back office behind the pile of metal saucepans; or
at one of the dry-goods stores, in the little parlor in the rear of
the bales of calico.&nbsp; At the present time I believe that there
are two or three open bars in Salt Lake, Brigham Young having
recognized the right of the "Saints" to "liquor up"
occasionally.&nbsp; But whatever other failings they may have,
intemperance cannot be laid to their charge.&nbsp; Among the
Mormons there are no paupers, no gamblers, and no drunkards.)</p>

"Picture of The Overland Mail Coach." /></center>
<p>There is the Overland Mail Coach.&mdash;That is, the den on
wheels in which we have been crammed for the past ten days and ten
nights.&mdash;Those of you who have been in Newgate*
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<b>and
stayed there any length of time&mdash;as visitors</b>&mdash;can
realize how I felt.</p>
<p>*(The manner in which Artemus uttered this joke was peculiarly
characteristic of his style of lecturing.&nbsp; The commencement of
the sentence was spoken as if unpremeditated; then when he had got
as far as the word "Newgate," he paused, as if wishing to call back
that which he had said.&nbsp; The applause was unfailingly
uproarious.)</p>
<p>The American Overland Mail Route commences at
Sacramento&mdash;California&mdash;and ends at
Atchison&mdash;Kansas.&nbsp; The distance is two thousand two
hundred miles&mdash;but you go part of the way by rail.&nbsp; The
Pacific Railway is now completed from
Sacramento&mdash;California&mdash;to
Fulsom&mdash;California&mdash;which only leaves two thousand two
hundred and eleven miles, to go by coach.&nbsp; <b>This breaks the
monotony</b>&mdash;it came very near breaking my back.</p>

"Picture of The Mormon Theatre." /></center>
<p>This edifice is the exclusive property of Brigham Young.&nbsp;
It will comfortably hold 3,000 persons&mdash;and I beg you will
believe me when I inform you that its interior is quite as
brilliant as that of any theatre in London.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actors are all Mormon amateurs, who charge nothing for their
services.</p>
<p>You must know that very little money is taken at the doors of
this theatre.&nbsp; The Mormons mostly pay in grain&mdash;and all
sorts of articles.</p>
<p>The night I gave my little lecture there&mdash;among my receipts
were
corn&mdash;flour&mdash;pork&mdash;cheese&mdash;chickens&mdash;<b>on
foot and in the shell</b>.</p>
<p>One family went in <font size="2">on a live pig</font>&mdash;and
a man attempted to pass a "yaller dog" at the Box Office&mdash;but
my agent repulsed him.&nbsp; One offered me a doll for
admission&mdash;another infants' clothing.&mdash;I refused to take
that.&mdash;<b>As a general rule I do refuse.</b></p>
<p>In the middle of the parquet&mdash;in a rocking chair&mdash;with
his hat on&mdash;sits Brigham Young.&nbsp; When the play
drags&mdash;he either goes out or falls into a tranquil sleep.</p>
<p>A portion of the dress-circle is set apart for the wives of
Brigham Young. From ten to twenty of them are usually
present.&nbsp; <b>His children fill the entire
gallery</b>&mdash;and more too.</p>

"Picture of East Side of Main Street, Salt Lake City." /></center>
<p>The East Side of Main Street&mdash;Salt Lake City&mdash;with a
view of the Council Building&mdash;The legislature of Utah meets
there.&nbsp; It is like all legislative bodies.&nbsp; They meet
this winter to repeal the laws which they met and made last
winter&mdash;and they will meet next winter to repeal the laws
which they met and made this winter.</p>
<p>I dislike to speak about it&mdash;but it was in Utah that I made
the great speech of my life.&nbsp; I wish you could have heard
it.&nbsp; I have a fine education.&nbsp; You may have noticed
it.&nbsp; I speak six different
languages&mdash;London&mdash;Chatham&mdash;and
Dover&mdash;&mdash;Margate&mdash;Brighton&mdash;and Hastings.&nbsp;
My parents sold a cow&mdash;and sent me to college when I was quite
young.&nbsp; During the vacation I used to teach a school of
whales&mdash;and there's where I learned to spout.&mdash;I don't
expect applause for a little thing like that.&nbsp; I wish you
could have heard that speech&mdash;however.&nbsp; If
Cicero&mdash;he's dead now&mdash;he has gone from us&mdash;but if
old Ciss* could have heard that effort it would have given him the
rinderpest.&nbsp; I'll tell you how it was.&nbsp; There are
stationed in Utah two regiments of U.S. troops&mdash;the 21st from
California&mdash;and the 37th from Nevada.&nbsp; The 20-onesters
asked me to present a stand of colors to the 37-sters&mdash;and I
did it in a speech so abounding in eloquence of a bold and
brilliant character&mdash;and also some sweet talk&mdash;real
pretty shopkeeping talk&mdash;that <b>I worked the enthusiasm of
those soldiers up to such a pitch</b>&mdash;<font size="2">that
they came very near shooting me on the spot</font>.</p>
<p>*(Here again no description can adequately inform the reader of
the drollery which characterized the lecturer.&nbsp; His reference
to Cicero was made in the most lugubrious manner, as if he really
deplored his death and valued him as a schoolfellow loved and
lost.)</p>

<p>Brigham Young's Harem.&mdash;These are the houses of Brigham
Young.&nbsp; The first on the right is the Lion House&mdash;so
called because a crouching stone lion adorns the central front
window.&nbsp; The adjoining small building is Brigham Young's
office&mdash;and where he receives his visitors.&mdash;The large
house in the centre of the picture&mdash;which displays a huge
bee-hive&mdash;is called the Bee House&mdash;the bee-hive is
supposed to be symbolical of the industry of the
Mormons.&mdash;Mrs. Brigham Young the first&mdash;now quite an old
lady&mdash;lives here with her children.&nbsp; None of the other
wives of the prophet live here.&nbsp; In the rear are the
schoolhouses where Brigham Young's children are educated.</p>
<p>Brigham Young has two hundred wives.&nbsp; <b>Just think of
that!</b>&nbsp; <font size="2">Oblige me by thinking of
that</font>.&nbsp; That is&mdash;he has eighty actual wives, and he
is spiritually married to one hundred and twenty more.&nbsp; These
spiritual marriages&mdash;as the Mormons call them&mdash;are
contracted with aged widows&mdash;who think it a great honor to be
sealed&mdash;the Mormons call it being sealed&mdash;to the
Prophet.</p>
<p>So we may say he has two hundred wives.&nbsp; He loves not
wisely&mdash;<b>but two hundred well</b>.&nbsp; He is dreadfully
married.&nbsp; <font size="2">He's the most married man I ever saw
in my life</font>.</p>
<p>I saw his mother-in-law while I was there.&nbsp; <b>I can't
exactly tell you how many there is of her</b>&mdash;but it's a good
deal.&nbsp; It strikes me that one mother-in-law is about enough to
have in a family&mdash;<font size="2">unless you're very fond of
excitement</font>.</p>
<p>A few days before my arrival in Utah&mdash;Brigham was married
again&mdash;to a young and really pretty girl&mdash;but he says he
shall stop now.&nbsp; He told me confidentially that he shouldn't
get married any more.&nbsp; He says that all he wants now is to
live in peace for the remainder of his days&mdash;and have his
dying pillow soothed by the loving hands of his family.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;that's all right&mdash;that's all right&mdash;I
suppose&mdash;<b>but if <i>all</i> his family soothe his dying
pillow&mdash;he'll have to go out-doors to die</b>.</p>
<p>By the way&mdash;Shakespeare indorses polygamy.&mdash;He speaks
of the Merry Wives of Windsor.&nbsp; <b>How many wives did Mr.
Windsor have?</b>&mdash;but we will let this pass.</p>
<p>Some of these Mormons have terrific families.&nbsp; I lectured
one night by invitation in the Mormon village of Provost, but
during the day I rashly gave a leading Mormon an order admitting
himself and family&mdash;<b>It was before I knew that he was much
married</b>&mdash;and they filled the room to overflowing.&nbsp;
<b>It was a great success&mdash;but I didn't get any money.</b></p>
<center><img src="images/34.gif" alt=
"Picture of Heber C. Kimball's Harem." /></center>
<p>Heber C. Kimball's Harem.&mdash;Mr. C. Kimball is the first
vice-president of the Mormon church&mdash;and would&mdash;
consequently&mdash;succeed to the full presidency on Brigham
Young's death.</p>
<p>Brother Kimball is a gay and festive cuss of some seventy
summers&mdash;or some'ers thereabout.&nbsp; <b>He has one thousand
head of cattle and a hundred head of wives.</b>&nbsp; He says they
are awful eaters.</p>
<p>Mr. Kimball had a son&mdash;a lovely young man&mdash;who was
married to ten interesting wives.&nbsp; But one day&mdash;while he
was absent from home&mdash;<b>these ten wives went out walking with
a handsome young man</b>&mdash;which so enraged Mr. Kimball's
son&mdash;which made Mr. Kimball's son so jealous&mdash;that he
shot himself with a horse pistuel.</p>
<p>The doctor who attended him&mdash;a very scientific
man&mdash;informed me that the bullet entered the inner
parallelogram of his diaphragmatic thorax, superinducing membranous
hemorrhage in the outer cuticle of his asiliconthamaturgist.&nbsp;
It killed him.&nbsp; I should have thought it would.</p>
<br />
<p>*(Soft music.)</p>
<br />
<p>*(Here Artemus Ward's pianist [following instructions] sometimes
played the dead march from "Saul."&nbsp; At other times, the Welsh
air of "Poor Mary Anne;" or anything else replete with sadness
which might chance to strike his fancy.&nbsp; The effect was
irresistibly comic.)</p>
<p>I hope his sad end will be a warning to all young wives who go
out walking with handsome young men.&nbsp; Mr. Kimball's son is now
no more.&nbsp; He sleeps beneath the cypress&mdash;the
myrtle&mdash;and the willow.&nbsp; This music is a dirge by the
eminent pianist for Mr. Kimball's son.&nbsp; He died by
request.</p>
<p>I regret to say that efforts were made to make a Mormon of me
while I was in Utah.</p>
<p>It was leap-year when I was there&mdash;and seventeen young
widows&mdash;the wives of a deceased Mormon&mdash;offered me their
hearts and hands.&nbsp; I called on them one day&mdash;and taking
their soft white hands in mine&mdash;<b>which made eighteen hands
altogether</b>&mdash;I found them in tears.</p>
<p>And I said&mdash;"Why is this thus?&nbsp; What is the reason of
this thusness?"</p>
<p>They hove a sigh&mdash;<font size="2">seventeen sighs of
different size</font>&mdash;They said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;soon thou wilt be gonested away!"</p>
<p>I told them that when I got ready to leave a place I
wentested.</p>
<p>They said&mdash;"Doth not like us?"</p>
<p>I said&mdash;"I doth&mdash;I doth!"</p>
<p>I also said&mdash;"I hope your intentions are honorable&mdash;as
I am a lone child&mdash;<font size="2">my parents being
far&mdash;far away</font>."</p>
<p>They then said&mdash;"Wilt not marry us?"</p>
<p>I said&mdash;"Oh&mdash;no&mdash;it cannot was."</p>
<p>Again they asked me to marry them&mdash;and again I
declined.&nbsp; When they cried&mdash;</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;cruel man! This is too much&mdash;oh! too much!"</p>
<p><b>I told them that it was on account of the muchness that I
declined.</b></p>

"Picture of the Mormom Temple." /></center>
<p>This is the Mormon Temple.</p>
<p>It is built of adobe&mdash;and will hold five thousand persons
quite comfortably.&nbsp; A full brass and string band often assists
the choir of this church&mdash;and the choir&mdash;I may
add&mdash;is a remarkably good one.</p>
<p>Brigham Young seldom preaches now.&nbsp; The younger
elders&mdash;unless on some special occasion&mdash;conduct the
services.&nbsp; I only heard Mr. Young once.&nbsp; He is not an
educated man&mdash;but speaks with considerable force and
clearness.&nbsp; The day I was there there was nothing coarse in
his remarks.</p>
<center><img src="images/36.gif" alt=
"Picture of The foundations of the Temple." /></center>
<p>The foundations of the Temple.</p>
<p>These are the foundations of the magnificent Temple the Mormons
are building.&nbsp; It is to be built of hewn stone&mdash;and will
cover several acres of ground.&nbsp; They say it shall eclipse in
splendor all other temples in the world.&nbsp; They also say it
shall be paved with solid gold.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worthy of remark that the architect of this
contemplated gorgeous affair repudiated Mormonism&mdash;and is now
living in London.</p>
<center><img src="images/37.gif" alt=

"Picture of the Great Salt Lake." /></center>
<p>Great Salt Lake.&mdash;The great salt dead sea of the
desert.</p>
<p>I know of no greater curiosity than this inland sea of thick
brine.&nbsp; It is eighty miles wide&mdash;and one hundred and
thirty miles long.&nbsp; Solid masses of salt are daily washed
ashore in immense heaps&mdash;and the Mormon in want of salt has
only to go to the shore of this lake and fill his cart.&nbsp;
Only&mdash;the salt for table use has to be subjected to a boiling
process.</p>
<p>These are facts&mdash;susceptible of the clearest possible
proof.&nbsp; They tell one story about this
lake&mdash;however&mdash;that I have my doubts about.&nbsp; They
say a Mormon farmer drove forty head of cattle in there
once&mdash;<b>and they came out first-rate pickled
beef.</b>&mdash;</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you will excuse my absence&mdash;I am a man
short&mdash;and have to work the moon myself*.</p>
<p>*(Here Artemus would leave the rostrum for a few moments, and
pretend to be engaged behind.&nbsp; The picture was painted for a
night-scene, and the effect intended to be produced was that of the
moon rising over the lake and rippling on the waters.&nbsp; It was
produced in the usual dioramic way, by making the track of the moon
transparent and throwing the moon on from the bull's eye of the
lantern.&nbsp; When Artemus went behind, the moon would become
nervous and flickering, dancing up and down in the most inartistic
and undecided manner.&nbsp; The result was that, coupled with the
lecturer's oddly expressed apology, the "moon" became one of the
best laughed-at parts of the entertainment.)</p>
<p><b>I shall be most happy to pay a good salary to any respectable
boy of good parentage and education who is a good moonist.</b></p>

<p>The Endowment House.</p>
<p>In this building the Mormon is initiated into the mysteries of

this building&mdash;but I have no possible means of knowing how

"Picture of Echo Canyon" /></center>
<p>Salt Lake City is fifty-five miles behind us&mdash;and this is
Echo Canyon&mdash;in reaching which we are supposed to have crossed
the summit of the Wahsatch Mountains.&nbsp; These ochre-colored
bluffs&mdash;formed of conglomerate sandstone&mdash;and full of
fossils&mdash;signal the entrance to the Canyon.&nbsp; At its base
lies Weber Station.</p>
<p>Echo Canyon is about twenty-five miles long.&nbsp; It is really
the sublimest thing between the Missouri and the Sierra
Nevada.&nbsp; The red wall to the left develops farther up the
Canyon into pyramids&mdash;buttresses&mdash;and
castles&mdash;honey-combed and fretted in nature's own massive
magnificence of architecture.</p>
<p>In 1856&mdash;Echo Canyon was the place selected by Brigham
Young for the Mormon General Wells to fortify and make impregnable
against the advance of the American army&mdash;led by General
Albert Sidney Johnson.&nbsp; It was to have been the Thermopylae of
Mormondom&mdash;but it wasn't. General Wells was to have done
Leonidas&mdash;but he didn't.</p>

<p>A more cheerful view of the Desert.</p>
<p>The wild snowstorms have left us&mdash;and we have thrown our
wolf-skin overcoats aside.&nbsp; Certain tribes of far-western
Indians bury their distinguished dead by placing them high in air
and covering them with valuable furs&mdash;that is a very fair
representation of these mid-air tombs.&nbsp; Those animals are
horses&mdash;I know they are&mdash;because my artist says so.&nbsp;
I had the picture two years before I discovered the fact.&mdash;The
artist came to me about six months ago&mdash;and said&mdash;"It is
useless to disguise it from you any longer&mdash;they <font size=
"2">are horses</font>."</p>
<center><img src="images/42.gif" alt=
"Picture of Our Encounter with the Indians." /></center>
<p>It was while crossing this desert that I was surrounded by a
band of Ute Indians.&nbsp; They were splendidly mounted&mdash;they
were dressed in beaver-skins&mdash;and they were armed with
rifles&mdash;knives&mdash;and pistols.</p>
<p>What could I do?&mdash;What could a poor old orphan do?&nbsp;
I'm a brave man.&mdash;The day before the Battle of Bull's Run I
stood in the highway while the bullets&mdash;those dreadful
messengers of death&mdash;<b>were passing all around me
thickly&mdash;IN WAGONS&mdash;on their way to the
battle-field.</b>*&nbsp;</p>
<p>*(This was the great joke of Artemus Ward's first lecture, "The
Babes in the Wood."&nbsp; He never omitted it in any of his
lectures, nor did it lose its power to create laughter by
repetition.&nbsp; The audiences at the Egyptian Hall, London,
laughed as immoderately at it, as did those of Irving Hall, New
York, or of the Tremont Temple in Boston.)</p>
<p>But there were too many of these Injuns&mdash;there were forty
of them&mdash;and only one of me&mdash;and so I said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Great Chief&mdash;I surrender."&nbsp; His name was
Wocky-bocky.</p>
<p>He dismounted&mdash;and approached me.&nbsp; I saw his tomahawk
glisten in the morning sunlight.&nbsp; Fire was in his eye.&nbsp;
Wocky-bocky came very close to me and seized me by the hair of my
head.&nbsp; He mingled his swarthy fingers with my golden
tresses&mdash;and he rubbed his dreadful Thomashawk across my
lily-white face.&nbsp; He said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Torsha arrah darrah mishky bookshean!"</p>
<p>I told him he was right.</p>
<p>Wocky-bocky again rubbed his tomahawk across my face, and
said&mdash;"Wink-ho&mdash;loo-boo!"</p>
<p>Says I&mdash;"Mr. Wocky-bocky"&mdash;says
I&mdash;"Wocky&mdash;<b>I have thought so for years&mdash;and so's
all our family.</b>"</p>
<p>He told me I must go to the tent of the Strong-Heart and eat raw
dog*.</p>
<p>*("Raw dog."&nbsp; While sojourning for a day in a camp of Sioux
Indians we were informed that the warriors of the tribe were
accustomed to eat raw dog to give them courage previous to going to
battle.&nbsp; Artemus was greatly amused with the
information.&nbsp; When, in after years, he became weak and
languid, and was called upon to go to lecture, it was a favorite
joke with him to inquire, "Hingston, have you got any raw
dog?")</p>
<p>It don't agree with me.&nbsp; I prefer simple food.&nbsp; <b>I
prefer pork-pie&mdash;because then I know what I'm
eating.</b>&nbsp; But as raw dog was all they proposed to give to
me&mdash;I had to eat it or starve.&nbsp; So at the expiration of
two days I seized a tin plate and went to the chief's
daughter&mdash;and I said to her in a silvery voice&mdash;<b>in a
kind of German-silvery voice&mdash;I said&mdash;</b></p>
<p>"Sweet child of the forest, the pale-face wants his dog."</p>
<p>There was nothing but his paws!&nbsp; I had paused too
long!&nbsp; Which reminds me that time passes.&nbsp; A way which
time has.</p>
<p>I was told in my youth to seize opportunity.&nbsp; I once tried
to seize one.&nbsp; He was rich.&nbsp; He had diamonds on.&nbsp; As
I seized him&mdash;he knocked me down.&nbsp; Since then I have
learned that he who seizes opportunity sees the penitentiary.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>I take it for granted you have heard of these popular
mountains.&nbsp; <b>In America they are regarded as a great
success</b>, and we all love dearly to talk about them.&nbsp; It is
a kind of weakness with us.&nbsp; I never knew but one American who
hadn't something&mdash;some time&mdash;to say about the Rocky
Mountains&mdash;and he was a deaf and dumb man, who couldn't say
anything about nothing.</p>
<p>But these mountains&mdash;whose summits are snow-covered and icy
all the year round&mdash;are too grand to make fun of.&nbsp; I
crossed them in the winter of '64&mdash;in a rough sleigh drawn by
four mules.</p>
<p>This sparkling waterfall is the Laughing-Water alluded to by Mr.
Longfellow in his Indian poem&mdash;"Higher-Water."&nbsp; <b>The

<p>&mdash;and she fainted on Reginald's breast!*</p>
<p>*"On Reginald's breast."&nbsp; (At this part of the lecture
Artemus pretended to tell a story&mdash;the piano playing loudly
all the time.&nbsp; He continued his narration in excited
dumb-show&mdash;his lips moving as though he were speaking.&nbsp;
For some minutes the audience indulged in unrestrained
laughter.)</p>

"Picture of The Prairie on Fire." /></center>
<p>A prairie on fire is one of the wildest and grandest sights that
can be possibly imagined.</p>
<p>These fires occur&mdash;of course&mdash;in the summer&mdash;when
the grass is dry as tinder&mdash;and the flames rush and roar over
the prairie in a manner frightful to behold.&nbsp; They usually
burn better than mine is burning to-night.&nbsp; <b>I try to make
my prairie burn regularly&mdash;and not disappoint the
public&mdash;but it is not as high-principled as I
am.</b>*&nbsp;</p>
<p>*(The scene was a transparent one&mdash;the light from behind so
managed as to give the effect of the prairie on fire. Artemus
enjoyed the joke of letting the fire go out occasionally, and then
allowing it to relight itself.)</p>
<center><img src="images/46.gif" alt=
"Picture of Brigham Young at home." /></center>
<p>The last picture I have to show you represents Mr. Brigham Young
in the bosom of his family.&nbsp; His family is large&mdash;and the
olive branches around his table are in a very tangled
condition.&nbsp; <b>He is more a father than any man I know.&nbsp;
When at home&mdash;as you here see him&mdash;he ought to be very
happy with sixty wives to minister to his comforts&mdash;and twice
sixty children to soothe his distracted mind.</b>&nbsp; Ah! my
friends&mdash;what is home without <font size="2">a
family</font>?</p>
<p>What will become of Mormonism?&nbsp; We all know and admit it to
be a hideous wrong&mdash;a great immoral strain upon the 'scutcheon
of the United States.&nbsp; My belief is that its existence is
dependent upon the life of Brigham Young.&nbsp; His administrative
ability holds the system together&mdash;his power of will maintains
it as the faith of a community.&nbsp; When he dies&mdash;Mormonism
will die too.&nbsp; The men who are around him have neither his
talent nor his energy.&nbsp; By means of his strength it is held
together.&nbsp; When he falls&mdash;Mormonism will also fall to
pieces.</p>
<p>That lion&mdash;you perceive&mdash;has a tail.&nbsp; It is a
long one already.&nbsp; Like mine&mdash;it is to be continued in

once.&nbsp; She gained strength so rapidly that she lifted the
cottage piano quite a distance from the floor, and then tipped it
over on to her mother-in-law, with whom she had some little
trouble.&nbsp; We like your lectures very much. Please send me a

<p>THE CRUISE OF THE POLLY ANN.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>In overhaulin one of my old trunks the tother day, I found the
follerin jernal of a vyge on the starnch canawl bote, Polly Ann,
which happened to the subscriber when I was a young man (in the
Brite Lexington of yooth, when thar aint no sich word as fale) on
the Wabash Canawl:</p>
<p>Monday, 2 P.M.&mdash;Got under wa.&nbsp; Hosses not remarkable
frisky at fust.&nbsp; Had to bild fires under 'em before they'd
start.&nbsp; Started at larst very suddent, causin the bote for to
lurch vilently and knockin me orf from my pins.&nbsp; (Sailor
frase.)&nbsp; Sevral passenjers on bored.&nbsp; Parst threw
deliteful country.&nbsp; Honest farmers was to work sowin korn, and
other projuce in the fields.&nbsp; Surblime scenery.&nbsp; Large
red-heded gal reclinin on the banks of the Canawl, bathin her
feet.</p>
<p>Turned in at 15 minits parst eleving.</p>
<p>Toosdy.&mdash;Riz at 5 and went up on the poop deck.&nbsp; Took
a grown person's dose of licker with a member of the Injianny
legislater, which he urbanely insisted on allowin me to pay
for.&nbsp; Bote tearin threu the briny waters at the rate of 2 Nots
a hour, when the boy on the leadin hoss shoutid&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sale hoe!"</p>
<p>"Whar away?" hollered the capting, clearin his glass (a empty
black bottle, with the bottom knockt out) and bringing it to his
Eagle eye.</p>
<p>"Bout four rods to the starbud," screamed the boy.</p>
<p>"Jes so," screeched the capting.&nbsp; "What wessel's that
air?"</p>
<p>"Kickin Warier of Terry Hawt, and be darned to you!"</p>
<p>"I, I, Sir!" hollered our capting.&nbsp; "Reef your arft hoss,
splice your main jib-boom, and hail your chamber-maid!&nbsp; What's
up in Terry Hawt?"</p>
<p>"You know Bill Spikes?" said the capting of the Warier.</p>
<p>"Wall, I reckin.&nbsp; He can eat more fride pork nor any man of
his heft on the Wabash.&nbsp; He's a ornament to his sex!"</p>
<p>"Wall," continued the capting of the Kickin Warier.&nbsp;
"Wilyim got a little owly the tother day, and got to prancin around
town on that old white mare of his'n, and bein in a playful mood,
he rid up in front of the Court 'us whar old Judge Perkins was a
holdin Court, and let drive his rifle at him.&nbsp; The bullet
didn't hit the Judge at all; it only jes whizzed parst his left
ear, lodgin in the wall behind him; but what d'ye spose the old
despot did?&nbsp; Why, he actooally fined Bill ten dollars for
contempt of Court!&nbsp; What do you think of that?" axed the
capting of the Warier, as he parst a long black bottle over to our
capting.</p>
<p>"The country is indeed in danger!" said our capting, raisin the
bottle to his lips.&nbsp; The wessels parted.&nbsp; No other
incidents that day.&nbsp; Retired to my chased couch at 5 minits
parst 10.</p>
<p>Wensdy.&mdash;Riz arly.&nbsp; Wind blowin N.W.E.&nbsp; Hevy sea
on, and ship rollin wildly in consekents of pepper-corns havin been
fastened to the forrerd hoss's tale.&nbsp; "Heave two!" roared the
capting to the man at the rudder, as the Polly giv a friteful
toss.&nbsp; I was sick, an sorry I'd cum.&nbsp; "Heave two!"
repeated the capting.&nbsp; I went below.&nbsp; "Heave two!" I
hearn him holler agin, and stickin my hed out of the cabin winder,
I <i>hev</i>.</p>
<p>The hosses became docile eventually, and I felt better.&nbsp;
The sun bust out in all his splender, disregardless of expense, and
lovely Natur put in her best licks.&nbsp; We parst the beautiful
village of Limy, which lookt sweet indeed, with its neat white
cottages, Institoots of learnin and other evijences of
civillizashun, incloodin a party of bald heded cullered men was
playing 3 card monty on the stoop of the Red Eagle tavern.&nbsp;
All, all was food for my 2 poetic sole.&nbsp; I went below to
breakfast, but vittles had lost their charms.&nbsp; "Take sum of
this," said the Capting, shovin a bottle tords my plate.&nbsp;
"It's whisky.&nbsp; A few quarts allers sets me right when my
stummick gits out of order.&nbsp; It's a excellent tonic!"&nbsp; I
declined the seductive flooid.</p>
<p>Thursdy.&mdash;Didn't rest well last night on account of a
uprore made by the capting, who stopt the Bote to go ashore and
smash in the windows of a grosery.&nbsp; He was brought back in
about a hour, with his hed dun up in a red handkercher, his eyes
bein swelled up orful, and his nose very much out of jint.&nbsp; He
was bro't aboard on a shutter by his crue, and deposited on the
cabin floor, the passenjers all risin up in their births pushing
the red curtains aside &amp; lookin out to see what the matter
was.&nbsp; "Why do you allow your pashuns to run away with you in
this onseemly stile, my misgided frend?" said a sollum lookin man
in a red flannel nite-cap.&nbsp; "Why do you sink yourself to the
Beasts of the field?"</p>
<p>"Wall, the fack is," said the capting, risin hisself on the
shutter, "I've bin a little prejoodiced agin that grosery for some
time.&nbsp; But I made it lively for the boys, deacon!&nbsp; Bet
yer life!"&nbsp; He larfed a short, wild larf, and called for his
jug.&nbsp; Sippin a few pints, he smiled gently upon the
passengers, sed, "Bless you! Bless you!" and fell into a sweet
sleep.</p>
<p>Eventually we reached our jerny's end.&nbsp; This was in the
days of Old Long Sign, be4 the iron hoss was foaled.&nbsp; This was
be4 steembotes was goin round bustin their bilers &amp; sendin
peple higher nor a kite.&nbsp; Them was happy days, when people was
intelligent &amp; wax figgers &amp; livin wild beests wasn't
scoffed at.</p>

<p>EDITER OF PLAY BILL.</p>
</center>
<p>Dr Sir,&mdash;Yrs, into which you ask me to send you sum leadin
incidents in my life so you can write my Bogfry for the papers, cum
dooly to hand.&nbsp; I hav no doubt that a article onto my life,
grammattycally jerked and properly punktooated, would be a addition
to the chois literatoor of the day.</p>
<p>To the youth of Ameriky it would be vallyble as showin how high
a pinnykle of fame a man can reach who commenst his career with a
small canvas tent and a pea-green ox, which he rubbed it off while
scrachin hisself agin the center pole, causin in Rahway, N.Y., a
discriminatin mob to say humbugs would not go down in their
village.&nbsp; The ox resoom'd agricultooral pursoots shortly
afterwards.</p>
<p>I next tried my hand at givin Blind-man concerts, appearin as
the poor blind man myself.&nbsp; But the infamus cuss who I hired
to lead me round towns in the day time to excite simpathy drank
freely of spiritoous licker unbeknowns to me one day, &amp; while
under their inflooance he led me into the canal.&nbsp; I had to
either tear the green bandige from my eyes or be drownded.&nbsp; I
tho't I'd restore my eyesight.</p>
<p>In writin about these things, Mr. Editer, kinder smooth em
over.&nbsp; Speak of 'em as eccentrissities of gen'us.</p>
<p>My next ventur would hav bin a success if I hadn't tried to do
too much.&nbsp; I got up a series of wax figgers, and among others
one of Socrates.&nbsp; I tho't a wax figger of old Sock. would be
poplar with eddycated peple, but unfortinitly I put a Brown linen
duster and a U.S. Army regulation cap on him, which peple with
classycal eddycations said it was a farce.&nbsp; This enterprise
was onfortnit in other respecks.&nbsp; At a certin town I
advertised a wax figger of the Hon'ble Amos Perkins, who was a
Railroad President, and a great person in them parts.&nbsp; But it
appeared I had shown the same figger for a Pirut named Gibbs in
that town the previs season, which created a intense toomult, &amp;
the audience remarked "shame onto me," &amp; other statements of
the same similarness.&nbsp; I tried to mollify em.&nbsp; I told 'em
that any family possessin children might have my she tiger to play
with half a day, &amp; I wouldn't charge 'em a cent, but alars! it
was of no avail.&nbsp; I was forced to leave, &amp; I infer from a
article in the "Advertiser" of that town, in which the Editer says,
"Atho' time has silvered this man's hed with its frosts, he still
brazenly wallows in infamy.&nbsp; Still are his snakes stuffed, and
his wax works unrelible.&nbsp; We are glad that he has concluded
never to revisit our town, altho', incredible as it may appear, the
fellow really did contemplate so doing last summer, when, still
true to the craven instincts of his black heart, he wrote the
hireling knaves of the obscure journal across the street to know
what they would charge for 400 small bills, to be done on yellow
paper!&nbsp; We shall recur to this matter again!"</p>
<p>I say, I infer from this article that a prejudiss still exists
agin me in that town.</p>
<p>I will not speak of my once bein in straitend circumstances in a
sertin town, and of my endeaverin to accoomulate welth by lettin
myself to Sabbath School picnics to sing ballads adapted to the
understandins of little children, accompanyin myself on a
claironett&mdash;which I forgot where I was one day, singing,
instid of "Oh, how pleasant to be a little child,"</p>
<center>
<p>"Rip slap&mdash;set em up again,<br />
Right in the middle of a three-cent pie,"</p>
</center>
<p>which mistake, added to the fact that I couldn't play onto the
claironett except makin it howl dismal, broke up the picnic, and
children said, in voices choked with sobs and emotions, where was
their home and where was their Pa? and I said, Be quiet, dear
children, I am your Pa, which made a young woman with two twins by
her side say very angryly, "Good heavens forbid you should ever be
the Pa of any of these innocent ones, unless it is much desirable
for them to expire igminyusly upon to a murderer's gallus!"</p>
<p>I say I will not speak of this.&nbsp; Let it be Berrid into
Oblivyun.</p>
<p>In your article, Mr. Editer, please tell him what sort of a man
I am.</p>
<p>If you see fit to kriticise my Show speak your mind
freely.&nbsp; I do not object to kriticism.&nbsp; Tell the public,
in a candid and graceful article, that my Show abounds in moral and
startlin cooriosities, any one of whom is wuth dubble the price of
admission.</p>
<p>I hav thus far spoke of myself excloosivly as a exhibiter.</p>
<p>I was born in the State of Maine of parents.&nbsp; As a infant I
attracted a great deal of attention.&nbsp; The nabers would stand
over my cradle for hours and say, "How bright that little face
looks!&nbsp; How much it nose!"&nbsp; The young ladies would carry
me round in their arms, sayin I was muzzer's bezzy darlin and a
sweety 'eety 'ittle ting.&nbsp; It was nice, tho' I wasn't old enuf
to properly appreciate it.&nbsp; I'm a healthy old darlin now.</p>
<p>I have allers sustained a good moral character.&nbsp; I was
never a Railroad director in my life.</p>
<p>Altho' in early life I did not inva'bly confine myself to truth
in my small bills, I have been gradoolly growin respectabler and
respectabler ev'ry year.&nbsp; I luv my children, and never mistake
another man's wife for my own.&nbsp; I'm not a member of any meetin
house, but firmly bel'eve in meetin houses, and shouldn't feel safe
to take a dose of laudnum and lay down in the street of a village
that hadn't any, with a thousand dollars in my vest pockets.</p>
<p>My temperament is billious, altho' I don't owe a dollar in the
world.</p>
<p>I am a early riser, but my wife is a Presbyterian.&nbsp; I may
add that I am also bald-heded.&nbsp; I keep two cows.</p>
<p>I live in Baldinsville, Indiany.&nbsp; My next door naber is Old
Steve Billins.&nbsp; I'll tell you a little story about Old Steve
that will make you larf.&nbsp; He jined the Church last spring, and
the minister said, "You must go home now, Brothern Billins, and
erect a family altar in your own house," whereupon the egrejis old
ass went home and built a reg'lar pulpit in his sittin room.&nbsp;
He had the jiners in his house over four days.</p>
<p>I am 56 (56) years of age.&nbsp; Time, with its relentless
scythe, is ever busy.&nbsp; The Old Sexton gathers them in, he
gathers them in!&nbsp; I keep a pig this year.</p>
<p>I don't think of anything more, Mr Ed'ter.</p>
<p>If you should giv my portrait in connection with my Bogfry,
please have me ingraved in a languishin attitood, learnin on a
marble pillar, leavin my back hair as it is now.&mdash;Trooly

<p><a name="serenade" id="serenade"></a>THE SERENADE.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>Things in our town is workin.&nbsp; The canal boat "Lucy Ann"
called in here the other day and reported all quiet on the
Wabash.&nbsp; The "Lucy Ann" has adopted a new style of Binnakle
light, in the shape of a red-headed girl, who sits up over the
compass.&nbsp; It works well.</p>
<p>The artist I spoke about in my larst has returned to
Philadelphy.&nbsp; Before he left I took his lily-white hand in
mine.&nbsp; I suggested to him that if he could induce the citizens
of Philadelphy to believe it would be a good idea to have white
winder-shutters on their houses and white door-stones, he might
make a fortin.&nbsp; "It's a novelty," I added, "and may startle
'em at fust, but they may conclood to adopt it.</p>
<p>As several of our public men are constantly being surprised with
serenades, I concluded I'd be surprised in the same way, so I made
arrangements accordin.&nbsp; I asked the Brass Band how much they'd
take to take me entirely by surprise with a serenade.&nbsp; They
said they'd overwhelm me with a unexpected honor for seven dollars,
which I excepted.</p>
<p>I wrote out my impromptoo speech severil days beforehand bein
very careful to expunge all ingramatticisms and payin particuler
attention to the punktooation.&nbsp; It was, if I may say it
without egitism, a manly effort; but, alars! I never delivered it,
as the sekel will show you.&nbsp; I paced up and down the kitchin
speakin my piece over so as to be entirely perfeck.&nbsp; My
bloomin young daughter, Sarah Ann, bothered me summut by singin,
"Why do summer roses fade?"</p>
<p>"Because," said I, arter hearin her sing it about fourteen
times, "because it's their biz!&nbsp; Let 'em fade!"</p>
<p>"Betsy," said I, pausin in the middle of the room and letting my
eagle eye wander from the manuscrip&mdash;"Betsy, on the night of
this here serenade, I desires you to appear at the winder dressed
in white, and wave a lily-white handkercher.&nbsp; D'ye hear?"</p>
<p>"If I appear," said that remarkable female, "I shall wave a
lily-white bucket of bilin hot water, and somebody will be
scalded.&nbsp; One bald-headed old fool will get <i>his</i>
share."</p>
<p>She refer'd to her husband.&nbsp; No doubt about it in my
mind.&nbsp; But for fear she might exasperate me I said nothin.</p>
<p>The expected night cum.&nbsp; At nine o'clock precisely there
was sounds of footsteps in the yard, and the Band struck up a
lively air, which when they did finish it, there was cries of
"Ward! Ward!"&nbsp; I stept out onto the portico.&nbsp; A brief
glance showed me that the assemblage was summut mixed.&nbsp; There
was a great many ragged boys, and there was quite a number of
grown-up persons evigently under the affluence of the intoxicatin
bole.&nbsp; The Band was also drunk.&nbsp; Dr. Schwazey, who was
holdin up a post, seemed to be partic'ly drunk&mdash;so much so
that it had got into his spectacles, which were staggerin wildly
over his nose.&nbsp; But I was in for it, and I
commenced:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Feller Citizens,&mdash;For this onexpected honor&mdash;"</p>
<p>LEADER OF THE BAND.&mdash;Will you give us our money now, or
wait till you git through?"</p>
<p>To this painful and disgustin interruption I paid no
attention.</p>
<p>"&mdash;for this onexpected honor, I thank you."</p>
<p>LEADER OF THE BAND.&mdash;"But you said you'd give us seven
dollars if we'd play two choons."</p>
<p>Again I didn't notice him, but resumed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I say, I thank you warmly.&nbsp; When I look at this crowd of
true Americans, my heart swells&mdash;"</p>
<p>DR. SCHWAZEY.&mdash;"So do I!"</p>
<p>A VOICE.&mdash;"We all do!"</p>
<p>"&mdash;my heart swells&mdash;"</p>
<p>A VOICE.&mdash;"Three cheers for the swells."</p>
<p>"We live," said I, "in troublous times, but I hope we shall
again resume our former proud position, and go on in our glorious
career!"</p>
<p>DR. SCHWAZEY.&mdash;I'm willin for one to go on in a glorious
career!&nbsp; Will you join me, fellow-citizens, in a glorious
career?&nbsp; What wages does a man git for a glorious career, when
he finds himself?"</p>
<p>"Dr, Schwazey," said I, sternly, "you are drunk.&nbsp; You're
disturbin the meetin."</p>
<p>DR. S.&mdash;Have you a banquet spread in the house?&nbsp; I
should like a rhunossyross on the half shell, or a hippopotamus on
toast, or a horse and wagon roasted whole.&nbsp; Anything that's
handy.&nbsp; Don't put yourself out on me account.</p>
<p>At this point the Band begun to make hidyous noises with their
brass horns, and an exceedingly ragged boy wanted to know if there
wasn't to be some wittles afore the concern broke up?&nbsp; I
didn't exactly know what to do, and was just on the point of doin
it, when a upper winder suddenly opened, and a stream of hot water
was bro't to bear on the disorderly crowd, who took the hint and
retired at once.</p>
<p>When I am taken by surprise with another serenade, I shall,
among other arrangements, have a respectful company on hand.&nbsp;
So no more from me to-day.&nbsp; When this you see, remember
me.</p>

<br />
<p>You axe me, sir, to sling sum ink for your paper in regards to
the new Irish dramy at Niblo's Garding.&nbsp; I will do it,
sir.</p>
<p>I knew your grandfather well, sir.&nbsp; Sum 16 years ago, while
I was amoosin and instructin the intellectoal peple of Cape Cod
with my justly pop'lar Show, I saw your grandfather.&nbsp; He was
then between 96 years of age, but his mind was very clear.&nbsp; He
told me I looked like George Washington.&nbsp; He said I had a
massiv intellect.&nbsp; Your grandfather was a highly-intelligent
man, and I made up my mind then that if I could ever help his
family in any way, I'd do so.&nbsp; Your grandfather gave me sum
clams and a Testament.&nbsp; He charged me for the clams but threw
in the Testament.&nbsp; He was a very fine man.</p>
<p>I therefore rite for you, which insures your respectability at
once.&nbsp; It gives you a moral tone at the word go.</p>
<p>I found myself the other night at Niblo's Garding, which is now,
by the way, Wheatley's Garding.&nbsp; (I don't know what's bcum of
Nib.)&nbsp; I couldn't see much of a garding, however, and it
struck me if Mr. Wheatley depended on it as regards raisin things,
he'd run short of gardin sass.&nbsp; [N.B.&mdash;These remarks is
yoomerous.&nbsp; The older I gro, the more I want to goak.]</p>
<p>I walked down the isle in my usual dignified stile, politely
tellin the people as I parsed along to keep their seats.&nbsp;
"Don't git up for me," I sed.&nbsp; One of the prettiest young men
I ever saw in my life showed me into a seat, and I proceeded to
while away the spare time by reading Thompson's "Bank Note
Reporter" and the comic papers.</p>
<p>The ordinance was large.</p>
<p>I tho't, from a cursiry view, that the Finnigan Brotherhood was
well represented.</p>
<p>There was no end of bootiful wimin, and a heap of good
clothes.&nbsp; There was a good deal of hair present that belonged
on the heds of peple who didn't cum with it&mdash;but this is a
ticklish subjeck for me.&nbsp; I larfed at my wife's waterfall,
which indoosed that superior woman to take it off and heave it at
me rather vilently; and as there was about a half bushil of it, it
knockt me over, and give me pains in my body which I hain't got
over yit.</p>
<p>The orkistry struck up a toon, &amp; I asked the Usher to nudge
me when Mr. Pogue cum on the stage to act.</p>
<p>I wanted to see Pogue; but, strange to say, he didn't act during
the entire evenin.&nbsp; I reckin he has left Niblo's, and gone
over to Barnum's.</p>
<p>Very industrious pepl are the actors at Barnum's.&nbsp; They
play all day, and in the evenin likewise.&nbsp; I meet'm every
mornin, at five o'clock, going to their work with their tin
dinner-pails.&nbsp; It's a sublime site.&nbsp; Many of them sleep
on the premises.</p>
<p>Arrah-na-Pogue was writ by Dion O'Bourcicolt &amp; Edward
McHouse.&nbsp; They writ it well.&nbsp; O'Bourcy has writ a
cartload of plays himself, the most of which is fust-rate.</p>
<p>I understand there is a large number of O'gen'tlmen of this city
who can rite better plays than O'Bourcy does, but somehow they
don't seem to do it.&nbsp; When they do, I'll take a Box of
them.</p>
<p>As I remarked to the Boy who squirted peppersass through a tin
dinner-horn at my trained Bear (which it caused that feroshus
animal to kick up his legs and howl dismal, which fond mothers fell
into swoons and children cride to go home because fearin the Bear
would leave his jungle and tear them from limb to limb), and then
excoosed himself (this Boy did) by sayin he had done so while
labourin under a attack of Moral Insanity&mdash;as I sed to that
thrifty youth, "I allus incurridge geenyus, whenever I see it."</p>
<p>It's the same with Dan Bryant.&nbsp; I am informed there are
better Irish actors than he is, but somhow I'm allus out of town
when they act, &amp; so is other folks, which is what's the
matter.</p>
<p>ACK THE 1.&mdash;Glendalo by moonlite.</p>
<p>Irishmen with clubs.</p>
<p>This is in 1798, the year of your birth, Mr. Editor.</p>
<p>It appears a patriotic person named McCool has bin raisin a
insurrection in the mountain districts, and is now goin to leave
the land of his nativity for a tower in France.&nbsp; Previsly to
doin so he picks the pockit of Mr. Michael Feeny, a gov'ment
detectiv, which pleases the gallery very much indeed, and they
joyfully remark, "hi, hi."</p>
<p>He meets also at this time a young woman who luvs him dearer
than life, and who is, of course, related to the gov'ment; and just
as the gov'ment goes agin him she goes for him.&nbsp; This is
nat'ral, but not grateful.&nbsp; She sez, "And can it be so?&nbsp;
Ar, tell me it is not so thusly as this thusness wouldst seem!" or
words to that effect.</p>
<p>He sez it isn't any other way, and they go off.</p>
<p>Irish moosic by the Band.</p>
<p>Mr. McCool goes and gives the money to his foster-sister, Miss
Arrah Meelish, who is goin to shortly marry Shaun, the Lamp
Post.&nbsp; Mac then alters his mind about goin over to France, and
thinks he'll go up-stairs and lie down in the straw.&nbsp; This is
in Arrah's cabin.&nbsp; Arrah says it's all right, me darlint, och
hone, and shure, and other pop'lar remarks, and Mac goes to his
straw.</p>
<p>The wedding of Shaun and Arrah comes off.</p>
<p>Great excitement.&nbsp; Immense demonstration on the part of the
peasantry.&nbsp; Barn-door jigs, and rebelyus song by McHouse,
called "The Drinkin of the Gin."&nbsp; Ha, what is this?&nbsp;
Soldiers cum in.&nbsp; Moosic by the band.&nbsp; "Arrah," sez the
Major, "you have those money."&nbsp; She sez, "Oh no, I guess
not."&nbsp; He sez, "Oh yes, I guess you have."&nbsp; "It is my
own," sez she, and exhibits it.&nbsp; "It is mine," says Mr. Feeny,
and identifies it.</p>
<p>Great confusion.</p>
<p>Coat is prodoosed from up-stairs.</p>
<p>"Whose coat is this?" sez the Major.&nbsp; "Is it the coat of a
young man secreted in this here cabin?"</p>
<p>Now this is rough on Shaun.&nbsp; His wife accoosed of theft,
the circumstances bein very much agin her, and also accoosed of
havin a hansum young man hid in her house.&nbsp; But does this bold
young Hibernian forsake her?&nbsp; Not much, he dont.&nbsp; But he
takes it all on himself, sez he is the guilty wretch, and is marcht
off to prison.</p>
<p>This is a new idea.&nbsp; It is gin'rally the wife who suffers,
in the play, for her husband; but here's a noble young feller who
shuts both his eyes to the apparent sinfulness of his new young
wife, and takes her right square to his bosom.&nbsp; It was
bootiful to me, who love my wife, and believe in her, and would put
on my meetin clothes and go to the gallus for her cheerfully,
ruther than believe she was capable of taking anybody's money but
mine.&nbsp; My marrid friends, listen to me:&nbsp; If you treat
your wives as though' they were perfeck gentlemen&mdash;if you show
'em that you have entire confidence in them&mdash;believe me, they
will be troo to you most always.</p>
<p>I was so pleased with this conduct of Shaun that I hollered out,
"Good boy!&nbsp; Come and see me!"</p>
<p>"Silence!" sum people said.</p>
<p>"Put him out!" said a sweet-scented young man, with all his new
clothes on, and in company with a splendid waterfall, "put this old
fellow out!"</p>
<p>"My young friend," said I, in a loud voice, "whose store do you
sell tape in?&nbsp; I might want to buy a yard before I go
hum."</p>
<p>Shaun is tried by a Military Commission.&nbsp; Colonel O'Grady,
although a member of the Commission, shows he sympathizes with
Shaun, and twits Feeny, the Gov'ment witness, with being a
knock-kneed thief, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Stanton's grandfather
was Sec'y of War in Ireland at that time, so this was entirely
proper.</p>
<p>Shaun is convicted and goes to jail.&nbsp; Hears Arrah singin
outside.&nbsp; Wants to see her a good deal.&nbsp; A lucky thought
strikes him; he opens the window and gets out.&nbsp; Struggles with
ivy and things on the outside of the jail, and finally reaches her
just as Mr. Feeny is about to dash a large wooden stone onto his
head.&nbsp; He throws Mr. F. into the river.&nbsp; Pardon
arrives.&nbsp; Fond embraces.&nbsp; Tears of joy and kisses a la
Pogue.&nbsp; Everybody much happy.</p>
<p>Curtain falls.</p>
<p>This is a very harty outline of a splendid play.&nbsp; Go and
see it&mdash;Yours till then,</p>

<p align="right">To Home, April 1866.</p>
<p>The Finians conveened in our town the other night, and took
steps toord freein Ireland.&nbsp; They met into the Town Hall, and
by the kind invite of my naber, Mr. Mulrooney O'Shaughnessy, whose
ancestors at least must have Irish blood in their veins, I went
over.</p>
<p>You may not be awair, by the way, that I've been a invalid here
to home for sev'ril weeks.&nbsp; And it's all owin to my own
improodens.&nbsp; Not feelin like eating a full meal when the cars
stopt for dinner, in the South, where I lately was, I went into a
Resterater and et 20 hard biled eggs.&nbsp; I think they effected
my Liver.</p>
<p>My wife says, Po, po.&nbsp; She says I've got a splendid liver
for a man of my time of life.&nbsp; I've heard of men's livers
gradooally wastin' away till they hadn't none.&nbsp; It's a
dreadful thing when a man's liver gives him the shake.</p>
<p>Two years ago comin this May, I had a 'tack of fever-'n-ager,
and by the advice of Miss Peasley who continues single and is
correspondinly unhappy in the same ratios I consulted a Spiritul
mejum&mdash;a writin' mejum.&nbsp; I got a letter from a cel'brated
Injin chief, who writ me, accordin to the mejum, that he'd been ded
two hundred and seventeen (217) years, and liked it.&nbsp; He then
said, let the Pale face drink sum yarb tea.&nbsp; I drinkt it, and
it really helpt me.&nbsp; I've writ to this talented savige this
time thro' the same mejum, but as yet I hain't got any
answer.&nbsp; Perhaps he's in a spear where they haint' got any
postage stamps.</p>
<p>But thanks to careful nussin, I'm improvin rapid.</p>
<p>The Town Hall was jam-full of peple, mostly Irish citizens, and
the enthusiasm was immense.&nbsp; They cheer'd everybody and
everything.&nbsp; They cheer'd me.</p>
<p>"Hurroo for Ward!&nbsp; Hurroo!"</p>
<p>They was all good nabers of mine, and I ansered in a pleasant
voice, "All right, boys, all right.&nbsp; Mavoorneen, och hone,
aroon, Cooshla macree!"</p>
<p>These Irish remarks bein' received with great applaus, I added,
"Mushler! mushler!"</p>
<p>"Good! good!" cried Captain Spingler, who desires the Irish vote
for country clerk; "that's fus' rate."</p>
<p>"You see what I'm drivin at, don't you, Cap?" I said.</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Well," I ansered, "I'm very glad you do, becaus I don't."</p>
<p>This made the Finians larf, and they said, "Walk up onto the
speaker's platform sir."</p>
<p>The speeches was red hot agin England, and hir iron heel, and it
was resolved to free Ireland at onct.&nbsp; But it was much
desirable before freein her that a large quantity of funds should
be raised.&nbsp; And, like the gen'rous souls as they was, funs was
lib'rally contribooted.&nbsp; Then arose a excitin discussion as to
which head center they should send 'em to&mdash;O'Mahony or
McRoberts.&nbsp; There was grate excitement over this, but it was
finally resolved to send half to one and half to 'tother.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Finnigan rose and said, "We have here to-night sum
citizens of American birth, whom we should be glad to hear.&nbsp;
It would fill our harts with speechless joy to hear from a man
whose name towers high in the zoological and wax-figger
world&mdash;from whose pearly lips&mdash;</p>
<p>Says I, "Go slow, Finny, go slow."</p>
<p>"We wish to hear," continued Mr. Finnigan, moderatin his stile
summut, "from our townsman, Mr. Ward."</p>
<p>I beg'd to be declined, but it wan't no use.&nbsp; I rose amid a
perfeck uproar of applause.</p>
<p>I said we had convened there in a meetin, as I understood it, or
rather in a body, as it were, in reference to Ireland.&nbsp; If I
knew my own hart, every one of us there, both grate and small had
an impulse flowin in his boosum, "and consequentially," I added, we
"will stick to it similar and in accordance therewith, as long as a
spark of manhood, or the peple at large.&nbsp; That's the kind of
man I be!"</p>
<p>Squire Thaxter interrupted me.&nbsp; The Squire feels the wrongs
of Ireland deeply, on accounts of havin onct courted the widder of
a Irish gentleman who had lingered in a loathsum dunjin in Dublin,
placed there by a English tarvern-keeper, who despotically wanted
him to pay for a quantity of chops and beer he had consoom'd.&nbsp;
Besides, the Squire wants to be re-elected Justice of the Peace.
"Mr. Ward," he said, "you've bin drinkin.&nbsp; You're under the
infloo'nce of licker, sir!"</p>
<p>Says I, "Squire, not a drop of good licker has passed my lips in
fifteen years.</p>
<p>[Cries of "Oh, here now, that won't do."]</p>
<p>"It is troo," I said.&nbsp; "Not a drop of good licker has
passed my lips in all that time.&nbsp; I don't let it pass
'em.&nbsp; I reach for it while it's goin by!" says I.&nbsp;
"Squire, harness me sum more!"</p>
<p>"I beg pardon," said the Squire, "for the remark; you are sober;
but what on airth are you drivin at?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" I said, "that's just it.&nbsp; That's what I've bin axin
myself during the entire evenin.&nbsp; What is this grate meetin
drivin at?&nbsp; What's all the grate Finian meetins drivin at all
over the country?</p>
<p>"My Irish frens, you know me well enuff to know that I didn't
come here to disturb this meetin.&nbsp; Nobody but a loafer will
disturb any kind of a meetin.&nbsp; And if you'll notice it, them
as are up to this sort of thing, allers come to a bad end.&nbsp;
There was a young man&mdash;I will not mention his name&mdash;who
disturb'd my show in a certain town, two years ago, by makin
remarks disrespectful of my animals, accompanied by a allosan to
the front part of my hed, which, as you see, it is
Bald&mdash;sayin,&mdash;says this young man, 'You sandpaper it too
much, but you've got a beautiful head of hair in the back of your
neck, old man.'&nbsp; This made a few ignent and low-mindid persons
larf; but what was the fate of that young man?&nbsp; In less than a
month his aunt died and left him a farm in Oxford county,
Maine!&nbsp; The human mind can pictur no grater misfortun than
this.</p>
<p>"No, my Irish frens, I am here as your naber and fren.&nbsp; I
know YOU are honest in this Finian matter.</p>
<p>"But let us look at them Head Centers.&nbsp; Let us look at them
rip-roarin orators in New York, who've bin tearin round for up'ards
a year, swearin Ireland shall be free.</p>
<p>"There's two parties&mdash;O'McMahoneys and McO'Roberts.&nbsp;
One thinks the best way is to go over to Canady and establish a
Irish Republic there, kindly permittin the Canadians to pay the
expenses of that sweet Boon; and the other wants to sail direck for
Dublin Bay, where young McRoy and his fair young bride went down
and was drownded, accordin to a ballad I onct heard.&nbsp; But
there's one pint on which both sides agree&mdash;that's the
Funs.&nbsp; They're willin, them chaps in New York, to receive all
the Funs you'll send 'em.&nbsp; You send a puss tonight to Mahony,
and another puss to Roberts.&nbsp; Both will receive 'em.&nbsp; You
bet.&nbsp; And with other pusses it will be sim'lar.</p>
<p>"I went into Mr. Delmonico's eatin-house the other night, and I
saw my fren Mr. Terence McFadden, who is a elekent and enterprisin
deputy Centre.&nbsp; He was sittin at a table, eatin a canvas-back
duck.&nbsp; Poultry of that kind, as you know, is rather high just
now.&nbsp; I think about five dollars per Poult.&nbsp; And a bottle
of green seal stood before him.</p>
<p>"'How are you, Mr. McFadden?' I said.</p>
<p>"'Oh, Mr. Ward!&nbsp; I am miserable&mdash;miserable!&nbsp; The
wrongs we Irishmen suffers!&nbsp; Oh, Ireland!&nbsp; Will a troo
history of your sufferins ever be written?&nbsp; Must we be ever
ground under by the iron heel of despotic Briton?&nbsp; But, Mr.
Ward, won't you eat suthin?'</p>
<p>"'Well,' I said 'if there's another caanvas-back and a spare
bottle of that green seal in the house, I wouldn't mind jinin you
in bein ground under by Briton's iron heel.'</p>
<p>"'Green turtle soup, first?' he said.</p>
<p>"'Well, yes.&nbsp; If I'm to share the wrongs of Ireland with
you, I don't care if I do have a bowl of soup.&nbsp; Put a bean
into it,' I said to the waiter.&nbsp; 'It will remind me of my
childhood days, when we had 'em baked in conjunction with pork
every Sunday mornin, and then all went up to the village church,
and had a refreshin nap in the fam'ly pew.'</p>
<p>"Mr. McFadden, who was sufferin so thurily for Ireland, was of
the Mahony wing.&nbsp; I've no doubt that some ekally patriotic
member of the Roberts wing was sufferin in the same way over to the
Mason-Dory eatin-house.</p>
<p>"They say, feller-citizens, soon you will see a Blow struck for
Irish liberty!&nbsp; We hain't seen nothin BUT a Blow, so
far&mdash;it's bin all blow, and the blowers in New York won't git
out of Bellusses as long as our Irish frens in the rooral districks
send 'em money.</p>
<p>"Let the Green float above the red, if that'll make it feel any
better, but don't you be the Green.&nbsp; Don't never go into
anything till you know whereabouts you're goin to.</p>
<p>"This is a very good country here where you are.&nbsp; You Irish
hav enjoyed our boons, held your share in our offices, and you
certainly have done your share of our votin.&nbsp; Then why this
hulla-balloo about freein Ireland?&nbsp; You do your frens in
Ireland a great injoory, too; because they b'lieve you're comin
sure enuff, and they fly off the handle and git into jail.&nbsp; My
Irish frens, ponder these things a little.&nbsp; 'Zamine 'em
closely, and above all find out where the pusses go to."</p>
<p>I sot down.&nbsp; There was no applaws, but they listened to me
kindly.&nbsp; They know'd I was honest, however wrong I might be;
and they know'd too, that there was no peple on arth whose
generosity and gallantry I had a higher respect for than the Irish,
excep when they fly off the handle.&nbsp; So, my feller citizens,
let me toot my horn.</p>
<p>But Squire Thaxter put his hand onto my hed and said, in a
mournful tone of vois, "Mr. Ward, your mind is failin.&nbsp; Your
intellect totters!&nbsp; You are only about sixty years of age, yet
you will soon be a drivelin dotard, and hav no control over
yourself."</p>
<p>"I have no control over my arms now," I replied, drivin my
elbows suddenly into the Squire's stomack, which caused that
corpulent magistrate to fall vilently off the stage into the
fiddlers' box, where he stuck his vener'ble hed into a base drum,
and stated "Murder" twice, in a very loud vois.</p>
<p>It was late when I got home.&nbsp; The children and my wife was
all abed.&nbsp; But a candle&mdash;a candle made from taller of our
own raisin&mdash;gleamed in Betsy's room; it gleamed for I!&nbsp;
All was still.&nbsp; The sweet silver moon was a shinin bright, and
the beautiful stars was up to their usual doins!&nbsp; I felt a
sentymental mood so gently ore me stealin, and I pawsed before
Betsy's window, and sung, in a kind of op'ratic vois, as follers,
impromtoo, to wit:</p>
<center>
<p>Wake, Bessy, wake,<br />
My sweet galoot!<br />
Rise up, fair lady,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I touch my lute!</p>
</center>
<p>The winder&mdash;I regret to say that the winder went up with a
vi'lent crash, and a form robed in spotless white exclaimed, "Cum
into the house, you old fool.&nbsp; To-morrer you'll be goin round
complainin about your liver!"</p>
<p>I sot up a spell by the kitchen fire readin Lewis Napoleon's
"Life of Julius Caesar."&nbsp; What a reckless old cuss he
was!&nbsp; Yit Lewis picturs him in glowin cullers.&nbsp; Caesar
made it lively for the boys in Gaul, didn't he?&nbsp; He slewd one
million of citizens, male and female&mdash;Gauls and
Gaulusses&mdash;and then he sold another million of 'em into
slavery.&nbsp; He continnered this cheerful stile of thing for sum
time, when one day he was 'sassinated in Rome by sum high-toned
Roman gen'lmen, led on by Mr. Brutus.&nbsp; When old Bruty inserted
his knife into him, Caesar admitted that he was gone up.&nbsp; His
funeral was a great success, the house bein crowded to its utmost
capacity.&nbsp; Ten minutes after the doors were opened, the Ushers
had to put up cards on which was prntd, "Standin Room Only."</p>
<p>I went to bed at last.&nbsp; "And so," I said, "thou hast no ear
for sweet melody?"</p>
<p>A silvery snore was my only answer.</p>

long past; but the old fun and genuine humour of the showman are as
enjoyable now as when first written.]</p>
<p align="right">Washington, April 17, 1863.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife stood before the lookin-glass, a fussin up her hair.</p>
<p>"What you doin, Betsy?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Doin up my back hair," she replied.</p>
<p>"Betsy," said I, with a stern air, "Betsy, you're too old to
think about such frivolities as back hair."</p>
<p>"Too old?&nbsp; <i>Too old?</i>" she screamed, "too old, you
bald-heded idiot!&nbsp; You ain't got hair enuff onto <i>your</i>
hed to make a decent wig for a single-brested grasshopper!"</p>
<p>The Rebook was severe, but merited.&nbsp; Hens4th I shall let my
wife's back hair alone.&nbsp; You heard me!</p>
<p>My little dawter is growin quite rapid, and begins to
scrootinize clothin, with young men inside of it, puthy
clost.&nbsp; I obsarve, too, that she twists pieces of paper round
her hair at nights, and won't let me put my arms round her any more
for fair I'll muss her.&nbsp; "Your mother wasn't 'fraid I'd muss
<i>her</i> when she was your age, my child," sed I one day, with a
sly twinkle into my dark bay eye.</p>
<p>"No," replied my little dawter, "she probly liked it."</p>
<p>You ain't going to fool female Young America much.&nbsp; You may
gamble on <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>But all this, which happened in Baldinsville a week ago, hain't
nothin to do with Washington, from whither I now write you, hopin
the iterms I hereby sends will be exceptable to the Gin-Cocktail of
America&mdash;I mean the "Punch" thereof.&nbsp; [A mild
wittikism.&mdash;A.W.]</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., is the Capital of "our once happy
country"&mdash;if I may be allowed to koin a frase!&nbsp; The D.C.
stands for Desprit Cusses, a numerosity which abounds here, the
most of whom persess a Romantic pashun for gratooitous
drinks.&nbsp; And in this conjunction I will relate an
incident.&nbsp; I notist for several days a large Hearse standin in
front of the principal tavern on Pennsylvany Avenoo. "Can you tell
me, my fair Castillian," sed I this mornin, to a young Spaniard
from Tipperary, who was blackin boots in the washroom&mdash;"can
you tell me what those Hearse is kept standin out there for?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see our Bar bisness is great.&nbsp; You've no idee of
the number of People who drink at our Bar durin a day.&nbsp; You
see those Hearse is necessary."</p>
<p><i>I saw.</i></p>
<p>Standin in front of the tarvuns of Pennsylvany Avenoo is a lot
of miserbul wretches,&mdash;black, white and ring-strickid, and
freckled&mdash;with long whips in their hands, who frowns upon you
like the wulture upon the turtle-dove the minit you dismerge from
hotel.&nbsp; They own yonder four-wheeled startlin curiositys,
which were used years and years ago by the fust settlers of
Virginny to carry live hogs to market in.&nbsp; The best carriage I
saw in the entire collection was used by Pockyhontas, sum two
hundred years ago, as a goat-pen.&nbsp; Becumin so used up that it
couldn't hold goats, that fair and gentle savage put it up at
auction.&nbsp; Subsekently it was used as a hospital for sick
calves, then as a hencoop, and finally it was put on wheels and is
now doin duty as a hack.</p>
<p>I called on Secretary Welles, of the Navy.&nbsp; You know he is
quite a mariner himself, havin once owned a Raft of logs on the
Connethycut river.&nbsp; So I put on saler stile and
hollered:&nbsp; "Ahoy, shipmet!&nbsp; Tip us yer grapplin
irons!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" he sed, nervously, "but mercy on us, don't be so
noisy."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, my heart!&nbsp; But let me sing about how Jack Stokes
lost his gal:&mdash;</p>
<center>
<p>'The reason why he couldn't gain her,<br />
Was becoz he's drunken
saler!'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</center>
<p>"That's very good, indeed," said the Secky, "but this is hardly
the place to sing songs in, my frend."</p>
<p>"Let me write the songs of a nashun," sed I, "and I don't care a
cuss who goes to the legislater!&nbsp; But I ax your
pardon&mdash;how's things?"</p>
<p>"Comfortable, I thank you.&nbsp; I have here," he added, "a copy
of the Middletown "Weekly Clarion" of February the 15, containin a
report that there isn't much Union sentiment in South Caroliny, but
I hardly credit it."</p>
<p>"Air you well, Mr. Secky," sed I. "Is your liver all
right?&nbsp; How's your koff?"</p>
<p>"God bless me!" sed the Secky, risin hastily and glarin wildly
at me, "what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothin partickler.&nbsp; Only it is one of the beauties of
a Republican form of gov'ment that a Cabnet offisser can pack up
his trunk and go home whenever he's sick.&nbsp; Sure nothin don't
ail your liver?" sed I, pokin him putty vilent in the stummick.</p>
<p>I called on Abe.&nbsp; He received me kindly.&nbsp; I handed him
my umbreller, and told him I'd have a check for it if he
pleased.&nbsp; "That," sed he, "puts me in mind of a little
story.&nbsp; There was a man, out in our parts who was so mean that
he took his wife's coffin out of the back winder for fear he would
rub the paint off the doorway.&nbsp; Wall, about this time there
was a man in a adjacent town who had a green cotton umbreller."</p>
<p>"Did it fit him well?&nbsp; Was it custom made?&nbsp; Was he
measured for it?"</p>
<p>"Measured for what?" said Abe.</p>
<p>"The umbreller?"</p>
<p>"Wall, as I was sayin," continnered the President, treatin the
interruption with apparent comtempt, "this man sed he'd known that
there umbreller ever since it was a pyrasol.&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said I, larfin in a respectful manner, "but what has this
man with the umbreller to do with the man who took his wife's
coffin out of the back winder?"</p>
<p>"To be sure," said Abe&mdash;"what was it?&nbsp; I must have got
two stories mixed together, which puts me in mind of another
lit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind, Your Excellency.&nbsp; I called to congratulate you
on your career, which has been a honest and a good
one&mdash;unscared and unmoved by Secesh in front of you and
Abbolish at the back of you&mdash;each one of which is a little
wuss than the other if possible!</p>
<p>"Tell E. Stanton that his boldness, honesty, and vigger merits
all praise, but to keep his under-garments on.&nbsp; E. Stanton has
appeerently only one weakness, which it is, he can't allus keep his
under-garments from flyin up over his hed.&nbsp; I mean that he
occasionally dances in a peck-measure, and he don't look graceful
at it."</p>
<p>I took my departer.&nbsp; "Good-bye, old sweetness!" sed Abe,
shakin me cordgully by the hand.</p>
<p>"Adoo, my Prahayrie flower!" I replied, and made my exit.&nbsp;
"Twenty-five thousand dollars a year and found," I soliloquized, as
I walked down the street, "is putty good wages for a man with a
modist appytite, but I reckon that it is wuth it to run the White
House."</p>
<p>"What you bowt, sah?&nbsp; What the debble you doin, sah?"</p>
<p>It was the voice of an Afrikin Brother which thus spoke to
me.&nbsp; There was a cullud procession before me which was
escortin a elderly bald-hedded Afrikin to his home in Bates
Alley.&nbsp; This distinguished Afrikin Brother had just returned
from Lybery, and in turnin a corner puty suddent I hed stumbled and
placed my hed agin his stummick in a rather strengthy manner.</p>
<p>"Do you wish to impede the progress of this procession,
sah?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not, by all means!&nbsp; Procesh!"</p>
<p>And they went on.</p>
<p>I'm reconstructing my show.&nbsp; I've bo't a collection of life
size wax figgers of our prominent Revolutionary forefathers.&nbsp;
I bo't 'em at auction, and got 'em cheap.&nbsp; They stand me about
two dollars and fifty cents (2 dols. 50 cents) per Revolutionary
forefather.</p>

GROUNDS.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>There is some fun outside the Fair Ground.&nbsp; Any number of
mountebanks have pitched their tents there, and are exhibiting all
sorts of monstrosities to large and enthusiastic audiences.&nbsp;
There are some eloquent men among the showmen.&nbsp; Some of them
are Demosthenic.&nbsp; We looked around among them during the last
day we honored the Fair with our brilliant presence, and were
rather pleased at some things we heard and witnessed.</p>
<p>The man with the fat woman and the little woman and the little
man was there.</p>
<p>"'Ere's a show, now," said he, "worth seeing.&nbsp; 'Ere's a
entertainment that improves the morals.&nbsp; P.T.
Barnum&mdash;you've all hearn o' him.&nbsp; What did he say to
me?&nbsp; Sez he to me, sez P.T. Barnum, 'Sir, you have the
all-firedest best show travelin!'&mdash;and all to be seen for the
small sum of fifteen cents!"</p>
<p>The man with the blue hog was there.&nbsp; Says he, "Gentle-MEN,
this beast can't turn round in a crockery crate ten feet square,
and is of a bright indigo blue.&nbsp; Over five hundred persons
have seen this wonderful BEING this mornin, and they said as they
come out, 'What can these 'ere things be?&nbsp; Is it alive?&nbsp;
Doth it breathe and have a being?&nbsp; Ah yes,' they say, 'it is
true, and we have saw a entertainment as we never saw afore.&nbsp;
'Tis nature's [only fifteen cents&mdash;'ere's your change, sir]
own sublime hand-works'&mdash;and walk right in."</p>
<p>The man with the wild mare was there.</p>
<p>"Now, then, my friends, is your time to see the gerratist
queeriosity in the livin' world&mdash;a wild mare without no
hair&mdash;captered on the roarin wild prahayries of the far
distant West by sixteen Injuns.&nbsp; Don't fail to see this
gerrate exhibition.&nbsp; Only fifteen cents.&nbsp; Don't go hum
without seein the State Fair, an' you won't see the State Fair
without you see my show.&nbsp; Gerratist exhibition in the known
world, an' all for the small sum of fifteen cents."</p>
<p>Two gentlemen connected with the press here walked up and asked
the showman, in a still small voice, if he extended the usual
courtesies to editors.&nbsp; He said he did, and requested them to
go in.&nbsp; While they were in some sly dog told him their
names.&nbsp; When they came out the showman pretended to talk with
them, though he didn't say a word.&nbsp; They were evidently in a
hurry.</p>
<p>"There, gentleMEN, what do you think them gentlemen say?&nbsp;
They air editors&mdash;editors, gentleMEN&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
of the Cleveland &mdash;&mdash;, and Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of the
Detroit &mdash;&mdash;, and they say it is the gerratist show they
ever seed in their born days!"</p>
<p>[Nothing but the tip ends of the editors' coat-tails could be
seen when the showman concluded this speech.]</p>
<p>A smart-looking chap was doing a brisk business with a gambling
contrivance.&nbsp; Seeing two policemen approach, he rapidly and
ingeniously covered the dice up, mounted his table, and
shouted:</p>
<p>"Ere's the only great show on the grounds!&nbsp; The highly
trained and performing Mud Turtle with nine heads and seventeen
tails, captured in a well-fortified hencoop, after a desperate
struggle, in the lowlands of the Wabash!"</p>
<p>The facetious wretch escaped.</p>
<p>A grave, ministerial-looking and elderly man in a white choker
had a gift-enterprise concern.&nbsp; "My friends," he solemnly
said, "you will observe that this jewellery is elegant indeed, but
I can afford to give it away, as I have a twin brother seven years
older than I am, in New York City, who steals it a great deal
faster than I can give it away.&nbsp; No blanks, my
friends&mdash;all prizes&mdash;and only fifty cents a chance.&nbsp;
I don't make anything myself, my friends&mdash;all I get goes to
aid a sick woman&mdash;my aunt in the country, gentlemen&mdash;and
besides I like to see folks enjoy themselves!"</p>
<p>The old scamp said all this with a perfectly grave
countenance.</p>
<p>The man with the "wonderful calf with five legs and a huming
head," and "the philosophical lung-tester," were there.&nbsp; Then
there was the Flying Circus and any number of other ingenious
contrivances to relieve young ladies and gentlemen from the rural
districts of their spare change.</p>
<p>A young man was bitterly bewailing the loss of his watch, which
had been cut from his pocket by some thief.</p>
<p>"You ain't smart," said a middle-aged individual in a dingy
Kossuth hat with a feather in it, and who had a very
you-can't-fool-me look. "I've been to the State Fair before, I want
yer to understan, and knows my bizniss aboard a propeller.&nbsp;
Here's MY money," he exultingly cried, slapping his pantaloons'
pocket.</p>
<p>About half an hour after this we saw this smart individual
rushing frantically around after a policeman.&nbsp; Somebody had
adroitly relieved him of HIS money.&nbsp; In his search for a
policeman he encountered the young man who wasn't smart.</p>
<p>"Haw, haw, haw," violently laughed the latter; "by G&mdash;, I
thought you was smart&mdash;I thought you'd been to the State Fair
before."</p>
<p>The smart man looked sad for a moment, but a knowing smile soon
crossed his face, and drawing the young man who wasn't smart
confidentially toward him, said&mdash;</p>
<p>"There wasn't only fifteen cents in coppers in my
pocket&mdash;my MONEY is in my boot&mdash;they can't fool
me&mdash;I'VE BEEN TO THE STATE FAIR BEFORE!!"</p>

<p><a name="question" id="question"></a>THE NEGRO QUESTION.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>I was sitting in the bar, quietly smokin a frugal pipe, when two
middle-aged and stern-looking females and a young and pretty female
suddenly entered the room.&nbsp; They were accompanied by two
umberellers and a negro gentleman.</p>
<p>"Do you feel for the down-trodden?" said one of the females, a
thin-faced and sharp-voiced person in green spectacles.</p>
<p>"Do I feel for it?" ansered the lan'lord, in a puzzled
voice&mdash;"do I feel for it?"</p>
<p>"Yes; for the oppressed, the benighted?"</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as to which?" said the lan'lord.</p>
<p>"You see this man?" said the female, pintin her umbreller at the
negro gentleman.</p>
<p>"Yes, marm, I see him."</p>
<p>"Yes!" said the female, raisin her voice to a exceedin high
pitch, "you see him, and he's your brother!"</p>
<p>"No, I'm darned if he is!" said the lan'lord, hastily retreating
to his beer-casks.</p>
<p>"And yours!" shouted the excited female, addressing me.&nbsp;
"He is also your brother!"</p>
<p>"No, I think not, marm," I pleasantly replied.&nbsp; "The
nearest we come to that color in our family was the case of my
brother John.&nbsp; He had the janders for sev'ral years, but they
finally left him.&nbsp; I am happy to state that, at the present
time, he hasn't a solitary jander."</p>
<p>"Look at this man!" screamed the female.</p>
<p>I looked at him.&nbsp; He was an able-bodied, well-dressed,
comfortable-looking negro.&nbsp; He looked as though he might heave
three or four good meals a day into him without a murmur.</p>
<p>"Look a that down-trodden man!" cried the female.</p>
<p>"Who trod on him?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Villains! despots!"</p>
<p>"Well," said the lan'lord, "why don't you go to the willins
about it?&nbsp; Why do you come here tellin us niggers is our
brothers, and brandishin your umbrellers round us like a lot of
lunytics?&nbsp; You're wuss than the sperrit-rappers!"</p>
<p>"Have you," said middle-aged female No. 2, who was a quieter
sort of person, "have you no sentiment&mdash;no poetry in your
soul&mdash;no love for the beautiful?&nbsp; Dost never go into the
green fields to cull the beautiful flowers?"</p>
<p>"I not only never dost," said the landlord, in an angry voice,
"but I'll bet you five pound you can't bring a man as dares say I
durst."</p>
<p>"The little birds," continued the female, "dost not love to gaze
onto them?"</p>
<p>"I would I were a bird, that I might fly to thou!" I humorously
sung, casting a sweet glance at the pretty young woman.</p>
<p>"Don't you look in that way at my dawter!" said female No. 1.,
in a violent voice; "you're old enough to be her father."</p>
<p>"'Twas an innocent look, dear madam," I softly said.&nbsp; "You
behold in me an emblem of innocence and purity.&nbsp; In fact, I
start for Rome by the first train to-morrow to sit as a model to a
celebrated artist who is about to sculp a statue to be called Sweet
Innocence.&nbsp; Do you s'pose a sculper would send for me for that
purpose onless he knowd I was overflowing with innocency?&nbsp;
Don't make a error about me."</p>
<p>"It is my opinyn," said the leading female, "that you're a
scoffer and a wretch!&nbsp; Your mind is in a wusser beclouded
state than the poor nergoes' we are seeking to aid.&nbsp; You are a
groper in the dark cellar of sin.&nbsp; O sinful man!</p>
<center>
<p>'There is a sparkling fount&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, O come, and drink.'</p>
</center>
<p>No! you will not come and drink."</p>
<p>"Yes, he will," said the landlord, "if you'll treat.&nbsp; Jest
try him."</p>
<p>"As for you," said the enraged female to the landlord, "you're a
degraded bein, too low and wulgar to talk to."</p>
<p>"This is the sparklin fount for me, dear sister!" cried the
lan'lord, drawin and drinkin a mug of beer.&nbsp; Having uttered
which goak, he gave a low rumblin larf, and relapsed into
silence.</p>
<p>"My colored fren," I said to the negro, kindly, "what is it all
about?"</p>
<p>He said they was trying to raise money to send missionaries to
the Southern States in America to preach to the vast numbers of
negroes recently made free there.&nbsp; He said they were without
the gospel.&nbsp; They were without tracts.</p>
<p>I said, "My fren," this is a seris matter.&nbsp; I admire you
for trying to help the race to which you belong, and far be it from
me to say anything again carrying the gospel among the blacks of
the South.&nbsp; Let them go to them by all means.&nbsp; But I
happen to individually know that there are some thousands of
liberated blacks in the South who are starvin.&nbsp; I don't blame
anybody for this, but it is a very sad fact.&nbsp; Some are really
too ill to work, some can't get work to do, and others are too
foolish to see any necessity for workin.&nbsp; I was down there
last winter and I observed that this class had plenty of preachin
for their souls, but skurce any vittles for their stummux.&nbsp;
Now, if it is proposed to send flour and bacon along with the
gospel, the idea is really an excellent one.&nbsp; If, on t'other
hand, it is proposed to send preachin alone, all I can say is that
it's a hard case for the niggers.&nbsp; If you expect a colored
person to get deeply interested in a tract when his stummuck is
empty, you expect too much."</p>
<p>I gave the negro as much as I could afford, and the kind-hearted
lan'lord did the same.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>"Farewell, my colored fren, I wish you well, certainly.&nbsp;
You are now as free as the eagle.&nbsp; Be like him and soar.&nbsp;
But don't attempt to convert a Ethiopian person while his stummuck
yearns for vittles.&nbsp; And you, ladies&mdash;I hope you are
ready to help the poor and unfortunate at home, as you seem to help
the poor and unfortunate abroad."</p>
<p>When they had gone, the lan'lord said, "Come into the garden,
Ward."&nbsp; And we went and culled some carrots for dinner.</p>

<p><a name="health" id="health"></a>ARTEMUS WARD ON HEALTH.</p>
</center>
<br />
<p>[The following fragment from the pen of Artemus Ward was written
in the last days of his illness, and was found amongst the loose
papers on the table beside his bed.&nbsp; It contains the last
written jests of the dying jester, and is illustrative of that
strong spirit of humor which even extreme exhaustion and the near
approach of death itself could not wholly destroy.</p>
<p>There is an anecdote related of Thomas Hood to the effect that
when he was just upon the point of dying, his friend, Mr. F.O.
Ward, visited him, and, to amuse him, related some of his
adventures in the low parts of the metropolis in his capacity as a
sanitary commissioner.&nbsp; "Pray desist," said Hood; "your
anecdote gives me the back-slum-bago."&nbsp; The proximity of death
could no more deprive poor Artemus of his power to jest than it
could Thomas Hood.&nbsp; When nothing else was left him to joke
upon, when he could no longer seek fun in the city streets, or
visit the Tower of London and call it "a sweet boon," his own
shattered self suggested a theme for jesting.&nbsp; He commenced
this paper "On Health."&nbsp; The purport of it, I believe, was to
ridicule doctors generally; for Artemus was bitterly sarcastic on
his medical attendants, and he had some good reasons for being
so.&nbsp; A few weeks before he died, a German physician examined
his throat with a laryngoscope, and told him that nothing was the
matter with him except a slight inflammation of the larynx.&nbsp;
Another physician told him that he had heart disease, and a third
assured him that he merely required his throat to be sponged two or
three times a day, and take a preparation of tortoise shell for
medicine, to perfectly recover!&nbsp; Every doctor made a different
diagnosis, and each had a different specific.&nbsp; One alone of
the many physicians to whom Artemus applied seemed to be fully
aware that the poor patient was dying of consumption in its most
formidable form.&nbsp; Not merely phthisis, but a cessation of
functions and a wasting away of the organs most concerned in the
vital processes.&nbsp; Artemus saw how much the doctors were at
fault, and used to smile at them with a sadly scornful smile as
they left the sick room.&nbsp; "I must write a paper," said he,
"about health and doctors."&nbsp; The few paragraphs which follow
are, I believe, all that he wrote on the subject.&nbsp; Whether the
matter became too serious to him for further jesting, or whether
his hand became too weak to hold the pen, I cannot say.&nbsp; The
article terminates as abruptly as did the life of its gentle, kind,
ill-fated author.</p>
<p align="right">E.P.H.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ontil quite recent, I've bin a helthy individooal.&nbsp; I'm
near 60, and yit I've got a muskle into my arms which don't make my
fists resemble the tread of a canary bird when they fly out and hit
a man.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago I was exhibitin in East Skowhegan, in a
b'ildin which had form'ly bin ockepyied by a pugylist&mdash;one of
them fellers which hits from the shoulder, and teaches the manly
art of self defens.&nbsp; And he cum and said he was goin in free,
in consekence of previ'sly ockepyin sed b'ildin, with a large
yeller dog.&nbsp; I sed, "To be sure, sir, but not with those
yeller dogs."&nbsp; He sed, "Oh, yes."&nbsp; I sed, "Oh, no."&nbsp;
He sed, "Do you want to be ground to powder?"&nbsp; I sed, "Yes, I
do, if there is a powder-grindist handy."&nbsp; When he struck me a
disgustin blow in my left eye, which caused that concern to at once
close for repairs; but he didn't hurt me any more.&nbsp; I went for
him.&nbsp; I went for him energet'cally.&nbsp; His parents live
near by, and I will simply state that 15 minits after I'd gone for
him, his mother, seein the prostrate form of her son approachin the
house on to a shutter carrid by four men, run out doors, keerfully
looked him over, and sed, "My son, you've been foolin round a
thrashin masheen.&nbsp; You went in at the end where they put the
grain in, come out with the straw, and then got up in the
thingumajig and let the hosses tred on you, didn't you, my
son?"</p>
<p>You can jedge by this what a disagreeable person I am when I'm
angry.</p>
<p>But to resoom about helth.&nbsp; I cum of a helthy fam'ly.</p>
<p>The Wards has allus been noted for helthiness.</p>
<p>The fust of my ancestors that I know anything about was Abijah
Ward and his wife, Abygil Ward who came over with the Pilgrims in
the "Mayflower."&nbsp; Most of the Pilgrims was sick on the
passige, but my ancestor wasn't.&nbsp; Even when the tempist raged
and the billers howled, he sold another Pilgrim a kag of apple
sass.&nbsp; The Pilgrim who bo't it was angry when he found that
under a few layers of sass the rest was sawdust, and my ancestor
sed he wouldn't have b'leeved such wickedness could exist, when he
ascertained that the bill sed Pilgrim gave him was onto a broken
bank, and wasn't wuth the price of a glass of new gin.&nbsp; It
will be thus seen that my fust ancestor had a commercial mind.</p>
<p>My ancestors has all bin helthy people, tho' their pursoots in
life has been vari's.</p>

<p>[Among the papers, letters and miscellanea left on the table of
poor Ward was found the fragment which follows.&nbsp; Diligent
search failed to discover any beginning or end to it.&nbsp; The
probability is that it consists of part of a paper intended to
describe a comic trip round England.&nbsp; To write a comic
itinerary of an English tour was one of the author's favorite
ideas; and another favorite one was to travel on the Continent and
compile a comic "Murray's Guide."&nbsp; No interest attaches to
this mere scrap other than that it exemplifies what the writer

<p>At North Berwick there was a maniacal stampede toward the little
house by the railside, where they sell such immense quantities of
sponge-cake, which is very sweet and very yellow, but which lies
rather more heavily on the stomach than raw turnips, as I
ascertained one day from actual experience.&nbsp; This is not
stated because I have any spite against this little house by the
railside.&nbsp; Their mince-pies are nobly made, and their
apple-pies are unsurpassed.&nbsp; Some years ago there used to be a
very pretty girl at this house, and one day, while I was struggling
rapidly with a piece of mince-pie, I was so unfortunate as to wink
slightly at her.&nbsp; The rash act was discovered by a
yellow-haired party, who stated that she was to be his wife ere
long, and that he "expected" he could lick any party who winked at
her.&nbsp; A cursory examination of his frame convinced me that he
could lick me with disgustin ease, so I told him it was a complaint
of the eyes.&nbsp; "They are both so," I added, "and they have been
so from infancy's hour.&nbsp; See here!"&nbsp; And I commenced
winking in a frightful manner.&nbsp; I escaped, but it was
inconvenient for me for some time afterwards, because whenever I
passed over the road I naturally visited the refreshment house, and
was compelled to wink in a manner which took away the appetites of
other travellers, and one day caused a very old lady to state, with
her mouth full of sponge-cake, that she had cripples and drunkards
in her family, but thanks to the heavens above, no idiots without
any control over their eyes, looking sternly at me as she
spoke.</p>
<p>That was years ago.&nbsp; Besides, the wink was a pure
accident.&nbsp; I trust that my unblemished character&mdash;but I
will not detain you further with this sad affair.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
